<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>I have derived real pleasure from the
reading of "Betty's Battles," because I
am sure if we can only get it into the
hands of other "Bettys," that they will be
inspired and helped to take up arms in
their own cause, and fight, as Betty did,
for the love and peace and orderliness of
their own dear homes.</p>

<p>I think a fact is revealed in this story
which is not actually transcribed in black
and white. It is that the Grandmother&mdash;through
staying with whom Betty had
been so much blessed and helped&mdash;bore
the same surname as Betty's father. For
if she had brought up Betty's mother, I
am quite sure there never could have been
so much difficulty in the home as was the
case when Betty returned from her holiday!</p>

<p>This little book will, I believe, help our
Young People to realise their responsibility
towards their own homes and their
fathers and mothers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is more grievous at the present
time in many countries where civilisation
is most advanced, than the decay of all
that which is precious and beautiful in
home life. There are many causes which
have contributed to this, to which I cannot
allude here; but there is one remedy
which by the blessing of God cannot fail.
It is that our young women should be
enlightened and trained to acknowledge and
to carry their responsibilities for that work
which God has committed to women.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, it is God's arrangement
that women should beautify and adorn the
home. A home is an absolute necessity to
her; and only by the retirement and protection
of a good home, can women ever
be fitted to train and mould the nation's
youth. As a wise, far-seeing writer has
said: "It is not too much to say that the
prosperity or adversity of a nation rests in
the hands of its women. They are the
mothers of the men; they make and mould
the characters of their sons, and the centre
of their influence should be, as Nature
intended it to be, the home. Home is the
pivot round which the wheel of a country's
highest statesmanship should revolve; the
preservation of home, its interests, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
duties and principles, should be the aim
of every good citizen.... A happy home
is the best and surest safeguard against all
evil; and where home is not happy, there
the Devil may freely enter and find his
hands full. With women, and women
only, this happiness in the home must
find its foundation."</p>

<p>I believe in the successful mission of this
little book, and wish it good speed.<br /></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>"GOOD-BYE, GRANNIE"</h3>


<p>"Oh, Grannie, how sweet it all is here!
How can I ever go!" cries Betty.</p>

<p>Betty's bag stands by the gate. Betty
herself roams restlessly about the little
garden, while Betty's Grannie shades her
gentle old eyes from the morning sunshine,
and peers down the road.</p>

<p>Betty's bag is stout and bulgy; stuffed
full of Grannie's home-made goodies, including
a big plum-cake, and pots of
delicious jam.</p>

<p>Betty herself is not stout at all; indeed,
she is rather thin. She came to Grannie's
country home, five weeks ago, to grow
strong again after a bad illness; but though
the moorland breezes have brought colour
back to her cheeks, and strength to her
long limbs, they have given no plumpness
to either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty's Grannie&mdash;well, she <i>is</i> Grannie, a
true Army Grannie, with a heart large
enough to take in everybody's troubles, and
a spirit wise enough to find a cure for most
of them.</p>

<p>"The carrier's cart is a little later than
usual," remarks Grannie, still peering down
the road; "but don't worry, you've plenty
of time to do the ten miles to the station;
and Bob the carrier will see you safe into
the express. Of course, your father will
meet you when the train arrives, so you've
nothing to trouble about, dear."</p>

<p>"Nothing to trouble about!" Betty
turns round quickly. "Oh, Grannie, it's
leaving <i>you</i> that troubles me so dreadfully&mdash;how
can I go&mdash;how <i>can</i> I, when I'm only
just beginning to understand?"</p>

<p>During these five weeks Betty has grown
to love her dear good Grannie as she never
loved anyone before, for, week by week,
day by day, Grannie has been bringing her
nearer and nearer to God.</p>

<p>"Last night, dear child, you gave your
heart into the Lord's keeping," says
Grannie softly, laying a loving hand on
the girl's shoulder, "and He is with those
who trust Him always, wherever they may
go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Grannie; and while I'm
with you it seems so easy to do right&mdash;and
though you are so wise and good, you
never get cross with me when I make
mistakes, or answer too sharply&mdash;but, Oh,
it is so different&mdash;so very different at home!
Whatever shall I do without you?"</p>

<p>And Betty flings her arms round the old
woman's neck, and clings to her as though
she would never let her go.</p>

<p>"Your home is God's gift to you, Betty,"
says Grannie, gravely.</p>

<p>"My home? Grannie, it's <i>horrid</i> at
home sometimes! The rooms are so stuffy,
and dark, and untidy, and I hate untidy
rooms! The children are always quarrelling,
and they shout and stamp until my
head aches and aches, and mother never
seems to care. If only it were pretty and
clean and fresh like this place&mdash;if only
mother were like you!"</p>

<p>But Grannie's face grows graver still.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, Betty! Indeed, you must
not allow yourself to run on in this way.
Remember, you have given yourself to
God now, and you must do the work He
puts into your hands bravely and well.</p>

<p>"Of course, it is easier to be cheerful
and good when there is nothing to try us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Of course, it is easier to carry a light
burden than a heavy one. Your father is
poor, and there are many little ones. Your
mother has struggled through long years of
weary work and anxiety. It is your part
to be their help and comfort, Betty."</p>

<p>"I will try, indeed, I will; and I'll try
to remember all you've told me, all the dear
beautiful talks we've had together, and&mdash;and
last night, Gran."</p>

<p>"That's my own darling!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm really going to be good now,
and patient, and unselfish, and I'll help
mother, and teach the children, and make
our home as sweet as your home is. But,
Oh, dear Grannie, if you could only see our
home&mdash;it makes me so cross, for nobody
even tries to help, and they are all so careless,
and snap one up so."</p>

<p>Betty stops short, there is a queer little
twinkle in Grannie's eye that is almost like
a question.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know. <i>I</i> am snappy sometimes;
but they are all so unjust. When I
try to put things straight a bit, Bob is
sure to say I've lost some of his books;
and, Grannie, it isn't 'interfering' is it
to tell people of a thing when you know
it's wrong?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may be 'interfering' even to put
things straight, dear, unless you are very
careful to let love do the seeing, and
speaking, and doing.</p>

<p>"Courage, Betty! You were very weak
and listless when you came five weeks ago;
and your heart was heavy and sad. Now
you are my own strong Betty again. And
the Lord has come to dwell in your heart
and take its sadness away.</p>

<p>"Let Him reign in your heart, Betty;
give Him the whole of it. In His strength
you will learn to check the 'snappy' words
when they rise to your lips; to conquer the
discontented thoughts and careless habits.
You will learn to be happy and bright, and
to make all those around you happy too."</p>

<p>But Betty thinks, "Clearly Grannie
doesn't know how horrid things are at
home sometimes; if mother would only let
me manage altogether it wouldn't be half
so difficult."</p>

<p>"The carrier's cart, my child!"</p>

<p>Betty lifts her head from Grannie's
shoulder and hastily wipes her eyes.</p>

<p>The cart stops; the bulgy bag, the paper
parcel, and big bunch of sweet-smelling,
old-fashioned flowers are lifted in. Betty
turns to Grannie for the final kiss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Remember, dear, the little crosses of
daily life, borne bravely and cheerfully for
Jesus' sake, will make you a true Soldier,
and win a crown of glory by and by,"
whispers Grannie, as she presses her grandchild
in her kind arms.</p>

<p>Betty nods, and then turns her head away
very quickly; she dare not trust herself to
speak.</p>

<p>The cart moves away. Yes, now, indeed,
her holiday is over!</p>

<p>The blue sky, the golden gorse, the fresh,
sweet air of the moors, they are still around
her, but they belong to her no more.</p>

<p>Through a mist of tears she looks back
at the little cottage where she has been so
happy; Grannie still stands by the gate&mdash;round
that turn in the road beyond is the
village, and the little Salvation Army Hall,
where Grannie goes every Sunday.</p>

<p>It was at the close of the Meeting last
night that she gave her heart to God. Then
afterwards, in her dear little bedroom, with
her head buried in Grannie's lap, she felt
so strong, so sure&mdash;and now?</p>

<p>"Oh, dear; Oh, dear," she sobs, "it is
all so different at home!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>HOME AGAIN</h3>


<p>Betty dries her tears, and looks up.</p>

<p>She is in the train now, speeding towards
the great, smoky city, where she has lived
nearly all her life.</p>

<p>She watches the fields and woods flying
past, and her thoughts are sad.</p>

<p>Already Grannie seems far away. The
little white cottage is hidden among those
great moors yonder. She can see them
still, although they are growing fainter
every minute, fading into the blue of the
sky.</p>

<p>"Dear Grannie! how good she has been
to me&mdash;how happy I have been with her!"</p>

<p>She pulls a little Bible out of her pocket.
Grannie put it into her hands as she gave
her the first kiss this morning.</p>

<p>"I will read it every morning and evening,"
she thinks, "just as Grannie does.
When I see the words I shall remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the very sound of her voice and the look
in her dear eyes. That will help me so
much."</p>

<p>The thought comforts her, and she looks
about more cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Grannie has promised to write to me,
and I'm to write to her. How I shall love
her letters! I know just how she'll write&mdash;she
is so wise and strong, and yet so
loving and kind. But what sort of letters
shall I write to Grannie?</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I must tell her all my
troubles, and how hard I am fighting&mdash;<i>so</i>
hard! Then she must know everything
about the wonderful victories I mean to
win. How pleased she will be! I shall
have plenty of battles to fight, for home is
horrid sometimes&mdash;it really is.</p>

<p>"There's Bob; when Bob is in one of his
teasing fits it's almost impossible to keep
one's temper. But <i>I</i> mean to do it. Bob
shall have to own that he <i>can't</i> make me
cross.</p>

<p>"Then I do believe Clara is the most
trying servant in the whole world. Well,
I'm going to teach her that a dirty face
and torn apron are a real disgrace, and I'll
show her how to keep the kitchen just as
Grannie keeps hers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do wish I could persuade mother to
keep the sitting-room tidier, and finish her
house-work in the morning, and do her
hair before dinner. If she'd only let me
manage everything, I believe I should get
on much better.</p>

<p>"Jennie and Pollie must learn to sew,
and Harry to read, and Lucy really must
leave her perpetual poring over books and
take an interest in her home like other
girls. And father&mdash;dear old father!&mdash;he
shall have all his meals at the proper time,
instead of scrambling through them at the
last minute; and I'll keep his socks
mended, and his handkerchiefs ironed. Yes,
Grannie's quite right&mdash;there are heaps of
battles to fight every day. I'll fight them,
too; I'll manage everything; I'll be more
than conqueror! Oh, how surprised and
glad she will be!"</p>

<p>And Betty sinks back in her seat with
quite a self-satisfied smile.</p>

<p>And still the fields fly past; they are
flatter now; the woods have disappeared,
and every now and then the engine rushes
screaming through the station of a large
town.</p>

<p>Betty eats her lunch of Grannie's apples
and home-made cake. She is sad no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
longer. The battle-field is before her; she
is eager for the fight.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>glad</i> now that things are so tiresome
at home; there is so much more for
me to put right. What a change I'll make
in everything!"</p>

<p>All her doubts have vanished; she is sure
of success. As for failure and defeat, that
is clearly impossible!</p>

<p>It is late in the afternoon before long
lines of houses, stretching away in every
direction, begin to warn her that she is
nearing home.</p>

<p>Be sure her head is out of the window
long before the train draws up at the well-known
platform, and her eyes are eagerly
straining to catch the earliest possible
glimpse of father's face. For Betty loves
her father dearly.</p>

<p>There he is! The platform is crowded,
but she sees him directly. He sees her,
too, and, pushing his way through the
crowd, he opens the carriage door, and she
springs into his arms.</p>

<p>"Aye, Betty, my girl, I'm glad to see
you back again!" he says; that is all.
But John Langdale is a man of few words,
and this is a great deal from him.</p>

<p>He shoulders her bag, and makes his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
through the pile of luggage, the bustling
porters, and anxious passengers, Betty
following as best she can.</p>

<p>Her head feels giddy and bewildered after
the long train journey, and the noise, and
hurry, and smoky air, all is so different
from the quiet country scenes she left eight
hours ago.</p>

<p>Her father does not speak again until
they are safely seated on the top of a homeward-bound
bus; and even then, before he
speaks a word, he turns to his daughter,
and looks searchingly in her face.</p>

<p>There is a change in Betty's face that
tells of more than the mere return of health
and strength.</p>

<p>"Aye, well, my girl!" he says softly.</p>

<p>Betty smiles confidingly into his eyes,
and nestles closer to his side.</p>

<p>He half smiles in return, and then turns
away with a sigh. For he thinks, "It is
the country air and her Grannie's care that
have made such a change in my Betty, and
now she will have neither."</p>

<p>"Well, how did you leave your Grannie?"
he says aloud.</p>

<p>"Oh, ever so well! And she sent lots
of love and messages&mdash;and other things&mdash;for
the children, you know. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
things are in the bag. Be careful you
don't smash the jam-pots! I'll tell you the
messages as I remember them. And the
love&mdash;Oh, father, Grannie showed me what
real love is; and, father, I&mdash;&mdash;" Betty
comes to a full stop.</p>

<p>"Well, well, my girl, what is it?" asks
her father, turning his eyes inquiringly to
her face.</p>

<p>"Grannie has taught me so many
things," she goes on, in a low voice, "and
somehow, without saying much, she made
me understand how selfish I have been;
how through all these years I have been
trying to do without God. And&mdash;and she
took me to The Army Meetings, and last
night I&mdash;I asked God to forgive me and
make me as good as Grannie."</p>

<p>Betty's voice has sunk to the merest
whisper, but father hears it above all the
roar of the traffic.</p>

<p>"That's right, my girl. God bless you,
Betty!" he says, heartily, and now at last
a bright smile lights up his careworn face.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" says father, presently,
and he signals to the driver. The bus
pulls up at the entrance to a small street,
father shoulders the bag, and Betty, scrambling
down after him, soon finds herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
standing on the shabby little front doorstep
of her home.</p>

<p>A narrow, dull street it is; closely packed
with dull houses, all built in one pattern,
all alike grey with smoke, all looking as
though no breath of spring air, or gleam
of spring sunshine, could ever find their
way through the close-shut windows.</p>

<p>All too swiftly Betty's thoughts travel
back to the white cottage in the hills, to
the sunny garden, the fresh moorland
breezes.</p>

<p>The contrast is too much for her; a big
lump seems to rise in her throat. Her eyes
fill with tears; her good resolutions fade
away.</p>

<p>She doesn't want to be at home&mdash;Oh,
that she were with Grannie now!</p>

<p>Father has found his key at last, and
fits it into the lock. At the same moment
there is a rush of noisy feet within, the
loud clamour of excited voices. Directly
the door is flung open Betty is surrounded
by a boisterous crowd of younger brothers
and sisters&mdash;they seize her, they dance
round her, shouting out their rough
welcome.</p>

<p>"We knew it was you! Mother, here's
our Betty! Come along, Betty." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they almost drag her down the passage
into the family sitting-room.</p>

<p>Tea is set on the round table. Betty's
quick eye notices that the tray is slopped
with milk, and the stained cloth askew.
"How different from Grannie's tea-table,"
she thinks bitterly.</p>

<p>"Where's mother?" she asks, after kissing
her brothers and sisters all round.</p>

<p>"She was rather late to-day, and so she's
only just gone upstairs to tidy herself,"
explains Lucy. Lucy is next in age to
Betty. "You mustn't go up, she'll be
down in a minute."</p>

<p>"This bag feels pretty heavy," exclaims
Bob, the eldest boy, "anything good in it,
Betty?" and he begins fumbling at the
fastening.</p>

<p>"My flowers&mdash;Oh, Bob, do be careful!"
cries Betty, rushing to the rescue of her
daffodils and wallflowers. How sweet and
fresh they looked this morning, how crushed
and faded now!</p>

<p>"You careless boy; you've broken the
stalks off ever so many! Put the bag
down. Oh, dear, why isn't mother here!
Father's washing his hands, I suppose.
Lucy, do ask mother to make haste; here's
the kettle boiling away, and the tea not in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the pot or anything." Betty is growing
more irritable every minute; but now mother
appears.</p>

<p>"Well, Betty, here you are at last,
then."</p>

<p>Mrs. Langdale is a large, fair-haired
woman. Her gown is only half-fastened,
and stray wisps of hair are hanging round
her face. This is nothing unusual, for
Betty's mother is scarcely ever neatly
dressed.</p>

<p>Betty knows this well enough. It would
be well if she understood the look of love
in her mother's eyes as clearly as she sees
the untidiness of her mother's dress.</p>

<p>"Well, Betty, I'm glad to have you
back again, that I am; there's so much to
be done in this house, and time slips away
so. Now, to-day, I really made up my
mind to have everything ready by the time
you came in, but what with one thing and
another&mdash;Pollie, take your fingers out of
the sugar-bowl, you naughty child&mdash;Jennie,
fetch the knives, they're in the scullery, I
forgot them; make haste now! Can't you
see your sister wants her tea?"</p>

<p>She pushes a few loose tags of hair out
of her eyes, and begins making the tea,
talking all the time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, my dear, did your Grannie send
any message to me? What sort of journey
did you have? How did those boots wear?
Now did you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Betty's too tired to talk just yet, I
think," interposes her father, coming in
that moment. "She'll tell us everything
after tea."</p>

<p>Indeed, Betty does feel dreadfully tired.
The noise and confusion bewilder her.
Every one seems to be talking at once. It
is all so different from the quiet orderliness
of Grannie's home.</p>

<p>The knives are brought at last, the tea
made, and for awhile the younger children
are too busy with their bread and butter
even for talk.</p>

<p>Tea over, however, the tumult begins
afresh. The tea-things are just pushed to
one side of the table, and then mother
begins to unpack the bag.</p>

<p>Shrieks of delight greet the various
packages, the table is soon strewn with
Grannie's good things. The paper is torn
from the cake; Bob seizes on a great pot
of blackberry jam, bumps against a chair
and drops the pot with a crash to the floor.
The sticky mess, mixed with broken glass,
spreads slowly over the carpet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"There you go, you tiresome boy!" cries
mother fretfully. "Always smashing something,
always spoiling things. If you eat
a bit of it you'll swallow broken glass, and
serve you right. Lucy, ask Clara for a
duster and pail of water to mop up the
mess. Who told you to touch that cake,
Pollie? Jennie, how dare you meddle with
the honey&mdash;you'll overset that next! I
don't believe there ever were such rude,
tiresome, disobedient children! I'm sure I
don't know what to do with you all.
Harry, Jennie, Pollie, I <i>won't</i> have that
cake eaten to-night! You shall all just
pack off to bed."</p>

<p>The younger children sober down a little
at this threat, and presently, between coaxings,
and slappings, and the promise of
unlimited cake to-morrow, they go off
noisily to bed.</p>

<p>How thankful Betty is when she manages
at last to escape to her own little room,
and lays her weary head on her pillow!</p>

<p>She is utterly tired out. Too tired to
remember any of her good resolutions; too
tired even to think.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE BATTLES BEGIN</h3>


<p>The morning is bright and clear, and
just one glint of sunshine has actually
found its way into the room. Betty sits
up in bed. She has slept soundly all
night, and feels thoroughly refreshed.</p>

<p>Grannie's daffodils and wallflowers, carefully
placed in a large glass on the little
toilet-table, have lifted their drooping heads,
and look almost as bright as they did
yesterday morning in their far-away country
home.</p>

<p>"The battle is to begin to-day," Betty
thinks, as she springs lightly out of bed.
"Yes, to-day I am to begin to change
everything in this untidy, stuffy old house&mdash;to-day
I must commence the fight that is
not to end until I have made it a really
bright, cosy home.</p>

<p>"Half-past six! I shouldn't wonder if
Clara hasn't got up yet; she's such a lazy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
girl in the mornings. Never mind, I'll
soon shame her out of that. One of the
very first things I have to do is to make
every one in this house understand that
they <i>must</i> get up early in the morning."</p>

<p>Betty's mind is so full of this grand idea
that she quite forgets to ask the Lord for
His blessing and guidance during the day.</p>

<p>Lucy is sleeping peacefully on her pillow
by the side of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits 'the bed'">the bed</ins> that Betty has just left. This
will never do.</p>

<p>"Come, Lucy, wake up!" and she shakes
her by the arm.</p>

<p>Lucy opens her blue eyes, and blinks at
her sleepily. "It isn't time to get up yet;
it can't be," she murmurs.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. You've all got into fearfully
lazy habits in this house. While I
was with Grannie I always got up at half-past
six."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighs Lucy, ruefully.</p>

<p>"Now, make haste. Those children are
going to be <i>properly</i> washed and combed
before they go to school this morning; it's
a disgrace to see them sometimes."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose it is," admits Lucy.
"But aren't you dreadfully tired, Betty,
after yesterday?"</p>

<p>"If I am, I'm not going to let that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stand in the way of doing my duty,"
answers Betty loftily.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighs Lucy, feeling quite
guilty because she would so much rather
stay in bed one extra half-hour.</p>

<p>But the stern resolution in Betty's face
shows no signs of relenting, and she begins
to dress.</p>

<p>Betty splashes vigorously in the cold
water, combs her hair back until not a
single hair is out of place, and runs
downstairs.</p>

<p>Clara, the little maid-of-all-work, is sleepily
laying the kitchen fire. Her dirty apron
has a great "jag" all across the front, and
her tumbled cap is set all askew on her
mass of dusty-looking hair.</p>

<p>"What, the fire not alight yet? Really,
Clara, this is too bad. How can you
expect to get through your day's work well
when you begin it so badly! Now just
get that kettle to boil as soon as possible,
and I'll prepare the porridge and haddock.</p>

<p>"And, Clara, your face is as smutty as
anything. Why don't you wash it properly?
And your hair's just dreadful."</p>

<p>Clara tosses her head indignantly, and
mutters something about "never having
time for anything in this house."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's plenty of time for everything;
it's all because you manage so badly," says
Betty severely. "Where's the porridge-pot?
Not cleaned; how shameful! And
here's the frying-pan with all the fat in it.
How can you expect to be ready in time
at this rate?"</p>

<p>Clara mutters that "Everything would be
right enough if some folks would let her
alone."</p>

<p>Betty takes no notice of this just now,
for Lucy appearing at this moment, she
orders her off upstairs to wash and dress
the younger children.</p>

<p>By dint of a great deal of most energetic
bustling on Betty's part, and sulky help
from Clara, the breakfast is actually ready
by eight o'clock, and the boys and younger
girls sent off to school in good time. Betty
feels greatly elated. "What a difference
already!" she thinks.</p>

<p>And father, coming in for breakfast, she
hurries down to the kitchen for his fish
and tea.</p>

<p>Returning with the tray, she meets her
mother coming downstairs.</p>

<p>"What, Betty, up already? I made
sure you would like to lie in bed a bit
and hurried down early on purpose."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Hurried</i> down, mother! Why, I've
been up since half-past six, and just sent
the children off to school."</p>

<p>"Dear me. Is it really so late? I made
sure the clock struck eight only a few
minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Half an hour, at least, mother," answers
Betty, sharply.</p>

<p>"You're going by the kitchen clock&mdash;that's
always wrong, you know."</p>

<p>"Everything <i>is</i> in this house, it seems to
me," snaps Betty, and she carries father's
breakfast into the sitting-room. Mother
follows her.</p>

<p>"Where's your father? Why, you don't
mean to say you've finished breakfast?
Good gracious me, Betty, the idea of
having the window open! What a shocking
draught, enough to blow one away,
and I've had the face-ache all this week.
Shut it down directly!"</p>

<p>"It's a lovely fresh morning for this
place, and air's better than anything.
Grannie always has <i>her</i> windows open,"
answers Betty in quite a hard voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay; the country's different,
and your Grannie is one of the strongest
people I ever saw." And Mrs. Langdale
glances nervously at the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, mother, the room was horribly
stuffy, and Grannie says&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How dare you set your Grannie up
against me in this way? If that's all you
learned by being with her you'd far better
have stayed at home."</p>

<p>"But <i>any</i> doctor would tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Betty, unless you close that
window at once I won't stay in the room!"
cries Mrs. Langdale, red with anger.</p>

<p>Betty's face flushes also, and she bangs
the window down in a fury.</p>

<p>"There! And anybody who knows
anything will tell you that's thoroughly
wrong!" she cries.</p>

<p>Perhaps so, Betty. But is there nothing
wrong about your method of trying to put
the mistake right?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Betty sits down hopelessly.</p>

<p>She has been home just a week now, and
things have gone from bad to worse.</p>

<p>She has tried hard&mdash;in her own fashion,
of course&mdash;she has been up early every
morning, and bustled about all day. Yet
all her grand ideas have resulted in nothing.
It seems to her, as she sits there on the
shabby little sofa, surrounded with piles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
unmended stockings, that the members of
her family are determined to fight against
any kind of improvement.</p>

<p>"They won't have the windows wide
open; they won't get up early, or try to be
tidy," she thinks, and her heart grows sore
and bitter as she remembers the fruitless
struggles of the past two or three days.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the use of trying when no one
seems to care whether things are properly
done or not?"</p>

<p>She glances round the room. The carpet
is worn and frayed; the book-shelves dusty,
the curtains faded and torn. Her eyes rest
on the piles of unmended stockings. They
have been there more than a week already.</p>

<p>"How horrid it all is&mdash;how perfectly
horrid! Why can't mother see that the
whole house is a regular disgrace, and the
children too&mdash;with their dirty hands and
rough hair, and rude, noisy ways? But
they won't obey me, though I scold them
ever so&mdash;and no wonder, with mother always
ready to take their part, and tell me not to
be hard on them! Of course, they go away
and forget everything directly. If mother
would only leave them to me, I'd <i>make</i>
them mind!</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock striking, and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
hasn't been down to the kitchen to arrange
about the dinner yet! There'll be nothing
ready for the children again when they
come in from school; and Clara will just
muddle through her work as usual. Oh,
dear, how sick I am of the whole thing!</p>

<p>"If I could only live with Grannie&mdash;or
even go out all day, and earn my living
like other girls. I'm quick at figures. If
I could be a clerk in the City, or something;
at least, I should be away from this
muddle most of the day. I should be
independent, too, and able to buy things
for the house when I see they're wanted&mdash;and
that would help father. Nobody really
understands me here, except father.</p>

<p>"Bob was cruel to speak to me as he
did this morning; and what I said was
perfectly true&mdash;his hands <i>did</i> look as though
he hadn't washed them for a week. It was
my duty to tell him that, and he had no
right to fly in a rage, and say I was
nagging. Nagging, indeed! Just because
I told him that it was disgraceful and disgusting
for a big boy to go about with
dirty hands!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/i035.png" width="359" height="600" alt="&quot;They make a good heap, don&#39;t they?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;They make a good heap, don&#39;t they?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"A quarter past, and mother still over
the newspaper&mdash;and she told me she wouldn't
be ten minutes! It's too bad. I know just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
what will happen. There'll be nothing
ready, and Clara will be sent out for some
tinned salmon or something at the last
minute. No, I won't have it!"</p>

<p>And Betty jumps up, all aglow with
anger, and running down the passage,
flings open the little front parlour door.</p>

<p>"Mother!"&mdash;very sharply&mdash;"don't you
know how late it is?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Langdale looks up rather vacantly.
"Late? how can you say so? I'm sure
I haven't been here over a quarter of an
hour."</p>

<p>"You've been here a whole hour, and
if you don't make the pudding at once
the children will have to do without
altogether!"</p>

<p>"How you do hurry and flurry one,
Betty. Well, I'll see to it."</p>

<p>Betty goes back to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must begin at something,"
she sighs wearily&mdash;"not that it makes much
difference."</p>

<p>Again her eyes fall on the stockings.
Hours of hard work would not get rid of
that hopeless pile.</p>

<p>On the first evening after her return
home, whilst as yet all her good resolutions
were hot in her, she had mended and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
put away all father's socks; but since then
there has seemed no time for anything.</p>

<p>"I must mend all those stockings to-morrow,"
mother has said each night; but
there the matter has ended.</p>

<p>Shall she mend some now? or dust? or
wash the curtains? or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The door is flung open, and Clara comes
in with a fresh armful of socks and stockings,
barely dry from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Missis says I'm to put these with the
rest," she giggles, in her irritating way.
"They make a good heap, don't they?"</p>

<p>That is the last straw. Betty waits until
she is out of the room, and then gives way
altogether.</p>

<p>"I can't bear it&mdash;I just can't!" she
whispers, tapping her foot on the floor.
"Grannie didn't know what it would be
like when she said all that about loving
one's home. I must get away from it&mdash;I
must!"</p>

<p>The door opens again. "Oh, Betty, I
just want you to&mdash;why, child, what is the
matter? Are you going to be ill again?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not!" Betty's heart
had grown softer as she thought of her
Grannie; but she hardens it directly she
hears her mother's voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, only everything's so horrid at home
that I mean to ask father to let me learn
typing."</p>

<p>"Betty, how can you be so ungrateful!
Just because things are a bit behindhand&mdash;and
that through your being away so
long! There, I didn't think it of you!"
And Mrs. Langdale goes angrily out of
the room.</p>

<p>Betty had certainly not thought of it in
this light. Indeed, she has been thinking
of little lately, save how to get things done
in her own way.</p>

<p>"What could Grannie mean by talking
as though I could become a real power for
good in my home?" she thinks bitterly.
"I've tried, and tried, and things only get
worse and worse; and I've made Bob
angry, and the children cross, and vexed
mother besides. Grannie must have been
wrong after all!"</p>

<p>Was Grannie wrong? Or is it just
possible there is still something wrong
with Betty herself?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>BETTY'S BIRTHDAY</h3>


<p>"To-day is my birthday."</p>

<p>That is Betty's first thought when she
awakes next morning, and the remembrance
soothes and pleases her.</p>

<p>"Surely, Bob will not be cross with me
to-day. Surely, father will smile when he
kisses me, and mother will make a real effort
to finish her work earlier. But Grannie's
letter will be best of all&mdash;a long letter it is
certain to be, and, perhaps, a box of sweet
country flowers besides&mdash;those I brought
from her little garden are all dead now."</p>

<p>Betty's heart feels lighter than it has for
some days past, and she runs downstairs
quite briskly.</p>

<p>How eagerly she listens for the postman's
knock as she helps Clara prepare the breakfast!
"Ah, he's in the street now&mdash;I can
hear his 'rat-tats'&mdash;they're coming nearer.
Now he's next door&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas, for poor Betty! The next knock
is at the house on the other side.</p>

<p>She darts upstairs. No, there is no letter
on the door-mat; there is no letter coming
to her at all! Grannie has forgotten the
day. Betty could cry with disappointment
and vexation.</p>

<p>But this is only the beginning.</p>

<p>Jennie, Pollie, and Harry never remember
any birthdays save their own&mdash;she had
expected nothing from them. But Lucy
and Bob, it is hard indeed that <i>they</i> should
take no notice of this all-important day
which makes her just fifteen years old.</p>

<p>Worse still, Bob is in a thoroughly bad
humour; and Lucy, having fallen asleep
after Betty awakened her this morning, is
ashamed of herself, and eats her breakfast
in silence.</p>

<p>Not a word does Betty say to remind
them. She is longing intensely for a birthday
greeting, but nothing would make her
confess it.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have forgotten <i>their</i> birthdays,"
she thinks bitterly. "I thought
they didn't really care much about me,
and this proves it."</p>

<p>"You needn't look at me like that!"
cries Bob sharply. "I shan't wash my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hands any oftener for you, Miss Particular,
in spite of all your naggings!" and he
snatches up his cap, and clatters out of the
room, banging the door after him.</p>

<p>Soon after father comes in for his breakfast.
Betty looks up eagerly. Alas! he
also has forgotten.</p>

<p>After this, mother's forgetfulness is not
surprising. She, too, takes her breakfast
almost in silence, and disappears into the
kitchen rather earlier than usual.</p>

<p>Betty's heart is very sore as she sets
about her morning work. Her head aches,
and she feels tired all over. She has just
tidied the fireplace when mother enters.</p>

<p>"The kitchen-range is smoking again,
Betty. I'm not going to have any more of
it, so I've sent Clara for the sweep."</p>

<p>Betty is horrified. "Why, mother, there's
no dinner cooked&mdash;not even a bit of
pudding!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to make do with this
fire&mdash;it can't be helped."</p>

<p>This is too much. Betty knows what
"having the sweep in" means.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you wait until to-morrow?"
she breaks out angrily. "It's
too bad&mdash;that it is! Isn't everything horrid
enough already without this?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>And she covers her face with her hands,
and bursts into a passion of tears.</p>

<p>"Why, Betty&mdash;Betty, for goodness' sake,
don't&mdash;what can be the matter?"</p>

<p>"It's my birthday!" cries Betty, "and
you've all forgotten&mdash;and I <i>did</i> think things
would be better to-day, and now they'll be
worse than ever!"</p>

<p>"Your birthday, child? So it is, I
declare! Well, I can't think how I came
to forget it! If I'd thought now, I would
have tidied up a bit&mdash;but there's so much
to do in this house&mdash;just no end to it, and
yet there's no peace, and everything in a
muddle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all because no one <i>wants</i> things to
be better!" sobs Betty.</p>

<p>"If you mean me, Betty, let me tell you
you've no right to speak like that to your
mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean everybody! I just hate everything,
<i>everything</i>!" cries Betty, stamping
her foot, and sobbing so wildly that Mrs.
Langdale is alarmed.</p>

<p>She forgets her own grievance directly,
in true motherly anxiety.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Betty, don't give way
like this; you've been working too hard,
my dear; keeping too close to the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Clara and I will manage the sweep; just
put on your hat, and go for a walk."</p>

<p>"I can't, my head aches dreadfully,"
sobs Betty.</p>

<p>"Then you must lie down a bit. Come,
come, you'll make yourself quite ill."</p>

<p>Betty's head is aching so badly now that
she can scarcely think. Presently, lying on
her bed, she grows calmer.</p>

<p>What a dreadful failure she has made of
it all! She has fought and struggled all
the week, only to meet defeat at the end.
What would Grannie say? How rudely
she spoke to mother just now&mdash;Grannie
wouldn't approve of that.</p>

<p>"But I couldn't help it, and I can't do
anything to make things better, or the
house nicer. The harder I try, the worse
it all gets. I don't see any way out of it
at all, but earning my own living, and
letting them all go on as they like. I
wonder what Grannie would say to such a
plan? Well, I can't ask her, she's too far
away; and, Oh, dear, dear, she's forgotten
my birthday!"</p>

<p>Worn out with crying and pain, presently
Betty falls asleep.</p>

<p>When she has slept for about an hour, a
loud "rat-tat" at the street door awakens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
her. She jumps up. The postman! Of
course, she had forgotten the twelve o'clock
post. She flies downstairs, still dizzy with
sleep. Mother and Clara have not heard
the knock, they are busy in the kitchen.</p>

<p>A letter and a parcel. Betty almost
snatches them from the postman's hands,
and scans them eagerly.</p>

<p>Yes, it is Grannie's well-known hand-writing.
How could she think dear Grannie
would forget her!</p>

<p>Betty hurries upstairs with her treasures.
"A book&mdash;Grannie has sent me a book&mdash;that's
just like Grannie; she knows I like
reading better than anything."</p>

<p>She strips off the brown paper with eager
fingers. The book looks quite delightful;
it is prettily bound, and nicely illustrated.
Betty turns over the leaves rapidly, and
her eyes fall on a picture that attracts her
attention directly.</p>

<p>By the open door of a rose-clad cottage
stands a little maiden. She wears the quaint
close cap and quilted petticoat of the olden
time, and is eagerly looking at something
which the dear old dame in front of her
holds tightly clasped beneath the fingers of
her right hand.</p>

<p>Somehow, the cottage reminds Betty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Grannie's cottage. The old dame is certainly
rather like Grannie, and the girl is, Oh,
just about her own age!</p>

<p>Did Grannie send the book because she
also saw the resemblance?</p>

<p>"I must find out," thinks Betty. "Mother
doesn't want me&mdash;she said so&mdash;and my head
still aches."</p>

<p>So she lies down again, and begins to
read, "The Talking-Bird: A Wonder-Tale."</p>

<p>"It's a real lovely story; I can see that.
I was rather afraid that a book from
Grannie might be rather dry&mdash;she's so <i>very</i>
good."</p>

<p>Poor Betty! She has a great deal to
learn yet, that is evident. Really good
people are not dull; books that are good
and true can certainly never be "dry."
Betty wants to be good, she wants to walk
in the Narrow Way, and follow her Saviour
faithfully; but it all seems such uphill work;
doing one's duty is such a tiresome, wearisome
business; trying to be good is such a
dull, uninteresting affair.</p>

<p>Her heart is still cold, you see; the fire
of the Holy Spirit has not yet warmed it
into loving life.</p>

<p>So Betty begins to read. The rose-clad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cottage looks sweet enough, but Betty soon
finds that there is very little sweetness in
the maiden's life. Poor Gerda's lot is a
hard one. She is always at work. She
must spin, and bake, and milk cows; yet
her stepmother never seems pleased with her.</p>

<p>Gerda's two brothers are out all day
cutting wood in the great pine forests, but
though she knits them warm stockings, and
tries her best to cook them nice suppers,
they never give her a smile, or a kiss, or a
loving word. And Gerda says to herself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It does not matter how I work, or what
I do, I can never please anybody at all."</p>

<p>Betty pauses a moment. "How very like
<i>my</i> experience!" she thinks. "Of course,
I have to do different work&mdash;mend horrid
stockings for Bob instead of knitting them,
and sweep and dust instead of spinning;
but the effect of it all is just the same, and
Bob is exactly like that. I do all I can to
please him. I always make the porridge
myself, because he says it's 'lumpy' when
Clara does it, but never a word of thanks
do I get. Why, he couldn't even trouble
to remember that to-day is my birthday,
and I saved up for weeks and weeks to
buy <i>him</i> a nice present on his birthday!
It's too bad!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before Gerda's father married again,"
Betty reads on, "she had been allowed to
manage the house as she pleased" ("I wish
I was"), "but now everything is changed.
Gerda loved to rise with the sun, and scour
the kitchen floor with white sand before
breakfast, and polish all the brass pans
until they shone like gold" ("I don't sand
floors or polish pans, but that's just how
I feel about getting my work done early"),
"but her stepmother liked hot cakes for
breakfast, and as she would not rise early
enough to bake them herself, Gerda had to
leave her work and cook cakes instead;
and because no one seemed to care for her,
or notice how hard she had to work, she
grew more discontented, and fretful, and
unhappy every day; and meantime all
around her became more difficult and sad."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, that's exactly like me!" sighs
Betty.</p>

<p>Then she goes on to read how a strange
little old woman, in a big red cloak, came
to the cottage door one day. Her eyes
were blue as the sky, and she carried a flat
basket slung over one arm.</p>

<p>"Gerda thought she had come to sell
ribbons and pins, and turned to shut the
door; but the old dame stopped her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
smilingly. 'I have come to <i>give</i>, and not
to sell,' she said.</p>

<p>"'You have been fretting, my child, and
it's troubled you are, and sore and bitter
you are feeling against those who fret you.
Eh, my dear, I'll soon better that!' and
her blue eyes seemed to dance with the
knowledge of some happy secret.</p>

<p>"But Gerda stood quite dumb with
amazement.</p>

<p>"Then the old dame raised her folded
hand towards Gerda, and unclasped it a
little.</p>

<p>"'Oh, how sweet!' she cried. There, in
the old woman's hand, nestled a tiny bird.
Its feathers were red as the heart of a rose,
and its eyes shone like diamonds.</p>

<p>"'It is for you. My bird will stay with
you as long as you need him, and smooth
all the fret of your life away.'</p>

<p>"Gerda stretched out eager hands towards
the beautiful bird. 'Oh,' she cried, 'if that
could only come true!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i049.png" width="360" height="600" alt="&quot;&#39;Oh, how sweet!&#39; she cried.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;Oh, how sweet!&#39; she cried.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"'It will come true, my child, if you do
as I bid you. You must allow my bird to
perch on your shoulder, and be with you
wherever you go. He is a talking bird,
and whenever you are tempted to give an
angry answer, or speak a bitter word'&mdash;Gerda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hung her head; alas! she knew that
this would be very often&mdash;'you must let the
bird speak for you. Only do this, and in a
few months you will be the happiest girl in
the world.'</p>

<p>"'But what will people say?' stammered
Gerda, quite bewildered.</p>

<p>"'Directly my bird touches your shoulder
he will become invisible; <i>you</i> will feel him,
but no one will see him; and when he
speaks, his voice will be so like yours that
no one can tell the difference. Your part
is to keep down the angry words that rise
to your lips. My sweet bird will do the
rest,' and she kissed the bird's bright eyes,
and placed him gently on Gerda's shoulder,
and, behold! though she could feel the
light fluttering of feathers against her cheek,
she could see nothing."</p>

<p>"What can be the meaning of this&mdash;what
is the bird going to do?" thinks
Betty, as she hastily turns the page.</p>

<p>Betty has quite forgotten her headache,
and reads on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just at that moment, Gerda saw her
little pet kid jump quite over the wall of
the yard where her father's fiercest watch-dog
was chained. 'Oh, it will be killed!'
she cried, and ran swiftly to the rescue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
But when she returned with the kid in her
arms, the old woman had gone. 'And I
never thanked her! You tiresome creature&mdash;it
was all your fault!'</p>

<p>"That is what she began to say as she
lifted her hand to beat the poor little kid,
but at the same instant she felt the invisible
bird fluttering at her cheek again, and, lo
and behold! a voice&mdash;a voice exactly like
her own, only much sweeter&mdash;struck in ere
she could finish the sentence: 'Poor little
kid, you knew no better, and I am sure the
old woman will understand I did not mean
to be ungrateful&mdash;she had such kind, wise
eyes.'</p>

<p>"Certainly the words were much wiser
than those she meant to use herself."</p>

<p>That is only the beginning. The story
goes on to tell how Gerda's life is altered
altogether through the gentle, loving words
spoken by the bird in her stead; how her
brothers grow to love her, and are never
so happy as when they can give her
pleasure, bringing her home all sorts of
treasures at the end of their day's work.
Lilies from the valley, wild strawberries
from the hill, honey from the woodbee's
nest; how her stepmother becomes kind and
thoughtful, and her father calls her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sunshine of the home&mdash;and all this because
the old dame gave her that wonderful
speaking-bird!</p>

<p>Betty reads to the end, and closes the
book with a sigh.</p>

<p>"What a pity such things can't be true!
Now, if <i>I</i> had a lovely rose-coloured bird
who would perch on my shoulder, and
always say exactly the right thing in my
place when I felt cross, or stupid, how
different everything would be!</p>

<p>"Dear me, what nonsense I am talking!
It's just a pretty child's story&mdash;that is all&mdash;and
I can't imagine why Grannie sent it
to me. I haven't read her letter yet. Dear
old Grannie&mdash;<i>she</i> didn't forget my birthday.
It was unkind of the others; just too
bad, after all I've done. Well, I'll see how
they like it themselves. I certainly shan't
worry much about presents for other
people's birthdays, if they won't even take
the trouble to remember mine!"</p>

<p>Betty rises, and, taking Grannie's letter
to the window, begins to read.</p>

<p>What love there is in the very first
words&mdash;what a warm birthday greeting!
Betty's eyes grow misty as she reads, and
she holds the page to her lips for a moment.</p>

<p>"Grannie <i>really</i> loves me," she murmurs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a long letter. Ah, here is something
about the book! Dear me, what can
Grannie mean?"</p>

<p>"'Has my Betty guessed the <i>name</i> of
Gerda's speaking-bird yet? Has she discovered
the secret of the happiness that
came to the little maiden of the story?'
("No, indeed; how could I?") 'Does
Gerda's story fit my dear Betty's own
case?' ("Part of it does, of course.")
'Yes, for my Betty has troubles and trials;
my Betty is tempted to think her own life
is very hard and dull; is tempted to give
up trying; is perhaps thinking of getting
rid of the worry and fret by turning away
from it all, and going out to work for
herself?' ("Now, how could Grannie have
found that out? I'm sure <i>I</i> never said a
word about being a typist while I was with
her!")</p>

<p>"'The bird's name was <i>Love</i>, Betty.
The wonderful change in Gerda's life was
brought about by pure, unselfish love.</p>

<p>"'In all this world there is no force so
strong as love, Betty&mdash;true love; the love
that suffereth long and is kind; love that
seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked;
love that beareth all things, believeth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
things; the love that our Lord Jesus Christ
gives to all those who truly love and follow
Him.'"</p>

<p>Love! Betty looks rather blank. Does
Grannie mean that she isn't loving people
enough?</p>

<p>"'The little maiden in the story had
been troubled and discontented, but after
she listened to the voice of the Spirit of
Love, and let it speak for her, all her trials
vanished away. The story of Gerda's Bird
is only a pretty tale, but, Betty, you are
one of God's soldiers now, and the Spirit
of Love has come to abide with you; to
dwell in your heart, and speak to your
soul. The Holy Spirit, dear, the Heavenly
Dove; the Lord's best gift to you.</p>

<p>"'Listen to it, Betty; let its voice speak
for you. When sharp, unloving words rise
to your lips, keep them fast closed until the
Love within you can make itself heard.</p>

<p>"'You want a happy home, my child;
you long for the love of all those around
you, but it is only by bringing the Lord
into all your thoughts about your home,
that it can be really happy&mdash;only by loving
others very much that you can win true
love in return.'"</p>

<p>For a long time Betty stands by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
window, thinking, thinking as she has
never done before.</p>

<p>"Is that <i>really</i> the way out of it? Can
love, and keeping one's temper, make all
that difference? Of course, I know that
Bob would like me better if I didn't scold
when he is rough and careless; and I'm
sure mother would rather I didn't worry
her about the house being so untidy and
badly managed. But then, if I <i>don't</i> scold
and worry, how can I get things into
proper order?"</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright thought, like a ray
of pure light, darts into her mind&mdash;"Does
Grannie mean me to work just as hard to
make things nicer, but in a different way?
To love everybody so much that I don't
get cross when they seem careless and unreasonable?</p>

<p>"Oh, have I been thinking too much of
myself&mdash;of my own plans? Oh, dear Lord,
help me, help me to seek the good of
others, help me to suffer long and be kind;
not to be easily provoked; help me to feel
that my home and all within it are precious
gifts from Thee!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>REAL TROUBLE</h3>


<p>Betty washes her face, brushes her hair,
and runs downstairs; new courage thrilling
her heart.</p>

<p>"Yes, now, indeed, I will try what love
can do! Now I really will keep my temper
whatever happens; now love shall speak for
me however aggravating things may be!"</p>

<p>She feels so sure of herself; nevertheless,
she has hardly been downstairs half a
minute before she nearly slips into her old
habits of irritation again.</p>

<p>An ominous rumbling in the direction of
the kitchen chimney announces that the
sweep is still at work. The children's
dinner-hour has nearly arrived, there is no
dinner ready, and the sitting-room fire has
not even been lighted.</p>

<p>"What <i>was</i> the use of telling me to go
away and rest, and then forgetting all about
the children's dinner in this way? It's too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
bad! I'd much rather have been without
the rest altogether than be worried like this,
and I shall just go and tell mother so&mdash;no,
I won't."</p>

<p>Betty stops short. Where are all the
good resolutions she made not five minutes
ago? Where is the Love she was to listen
to, and learn from?</p>

<p>"Mother has forgotten the dinner because
she is doing all the horrid, dirty
work of having the sweep herself, that I
might rest. I won't say anything; no, I
<i>won't</i>. I'll just run out and buy some
fish, and cook it myself, without saying a
word."</p>

<p>She lights the fire, buys the fish, prepares
and cooks it in her swift, methodical
fashion, and has dinner quite ready just
as Bob and the younger children troop in
from school, and Lucy returns from her
music-lesson.</p>

<p>"Dinner ready?" cries Bob roughly,
flinging his cap down on a chair.</p>

<p>"Bob, how dare you do that? Hang
your cap up in the hall, directly."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother; I shall want it again in
half a minute. Where's mother?"</p>

<p>A wave of indignation sweeps over Betty
at his careless answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not one scrap of dinner shall you have,
Bob, until your cap is hanging up in its
proper place; take it out at once!"</p>

<p>"Shan't; where's mother? I want my
dinner. I don't want any of your nagging."</p>

<p>Nagging&mdash;how Betty hates the word!
Bob knows her dislike of it well enough,
and always uses it when he means to be
especially aggravating. He does so now,
fully expecting her to begin scolding
violently.</p>

<p>But somehow her very dislike of the
word reminds her of Grannie's letter, with
its warning about troubles and trials. Is
she nagging? has she failed already? Yet
how rude Bob is&mdash;how wrong!</p>

<p>No, she <i>will</i> conquer; and she answers
quite gently.</p>

<p>"Bob, how can you expect the younger
ones to behave properly if you set them a
bad example? They all watch you," and
she goes out to call her mother to dinner.</p>

<p>The kitchen is in a truly dreadful state;
table, chairs, and saucepans, all heaped
together; a liberal sprinkling of soot over
everything; mother, with a great smudge
of soot across her face, Clara as grimy as
a sweep herself.</p>

<p>"Dinner? Why, I declare I forgot all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
about it! Can I come? Bless the child,
of course not. Just look at the state that
careless man has left everything in; it's
disgraceful."</p>

<p>"But, mother, dinner's all ready, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right; help the children,
and I'll come when I can."</p>

<p>Betty's feelings are all up in arms again.
She has cooked the dinner herself, and
mother won't even take the trouble to come
and eat it&mdash;her birthday dinner, too! Again
her indignation almost masters her.</p>

<p>"You must come, mother. Bob's horridly
cross."</p>

<p>"Poor boy. Something has upset him
at school, I expect. He's made to work
much too hard over those lessons. Now,
Clara, I've told you over and over again
that I won't have the table scrubbed before
the floor's swept. Take that pail away at
once, and fetch the soft broom!"</p>

<p>Betty sees that further interference will
be equally hopeless, and goes upstairs, the
spirit of rebellion surging in her heart.</p>

<p>"So unnecessary, all this fuss and muddle;
what possible good can 'Love' do to all
this sort of thing?"</p>

<p>Yet Love has already won one small
victory for her. Bob would not have hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
up his cap had she scolded for an hour.
But she had answered his last unkind remark
gently, and when she returns to the sitting-room
the cap is gone.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the day wears on, Betty
feels more and more despondent.</p>

<p>"I don't see how things could be worse,"
she thinks, "and I can't see how I can ever
make them any better."</p>

<p>The younger children are in bed now,
and mother is trying to wash the soot from
her hands and face in her own room.</p>

<p>"Father will be late to-night; he will
want his supper directly he comes home.
Of course, it will be left to me to get it. I
wonder what Lucy finds to do so perpetually
in her own room? I've a good mind to tell
her pretty plainly what I think of her selfish,
unsociable ways, always going away
by herself, and leaving me to attend to
everything," and Betty sighs wearily, and,
seating herself on the little sofa, begins to
sort over the heap of unmended stockings.</p>

<p>The next moment she is startled by a
loud double knock at the street door. She
jumps to her feet and stands listening.
What can it be?</p>

<p>Ah, now Clara is coming upstairs. She
is always so slow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>What is that? Clara screaming? Betty
flies down the passage.</p>

<p>"Oh, Oh, Oh!" shrieks Clara. "The
master's killed, and they've brought him
home in a cab!"</p>

<p>"Killed? No, no, miss; don't be frightened.
It's only a bad accident," says the
cabman, reassuringly, as he catches sight
of Betty's white face.</p>

<p>"A bad accident! Father? Oh, what is
it?" gasps Betty.</p>

<p>"Smashed his knee-cap, miss."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all?" cries Betty.</p>

<p>"All! Why, miss, that is the worst
kind of accident. Like as not, he'll never
put foot to ground again; he'd better by
far have broken both his legs. Is there
anyone in the house to help me get him in?"</p>

<p>For a minute Betty's head seems to whirl
round, and she cannot think. But with a
great effort she steadies herself.</p>

<p>"Bob, Bob!" she calls.</p>

<p>Bob has come up, and is standing staring
into the darkness beside her, Lucy's
frightened face just behind him.</p>

<p>"Bob, run in next door, and ask Mr.
Baker to come as quickly as ever he can;
we must have help. Father can't move.
Lucy, go and tell mother."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob darts off, and Betty goes down to
the cab door.</p>

<p>Father is lying back in the cab all
huddled together; one leg held stiffly
before him.</p>

<p>"Is that my Betty?" he says feebly.
"Don't be frightened, dear lass, I shall be
right enough presently." But the dreadful
look of pain on his face turns her quite sick.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker comes, and father is got into
the house; how, Betty never knows. Her
heart aches to hear the deep groan that
breaks from him when they lift him to the
sofa.</p>

<p>It is father who remembers the cabman,
and bids Betty take the purse from his
pocket, and pay the man. As she gently
feels for it, her hand encounters an odd
stocking from the unmended pile on which
father is lying, and the thought darts
through her mind, "Oh, to think I felt
things like <i>that</i> to be a trouble this
morning!"</p>

<p>Bob is off again to fetch the doctor.
Mother is in the room now, weeping, and
wringing her hands helplessly. Lucy stands
trembling with terror, and perfectly useless.
Only Betty seems to know what to do.</p>

<p>Betty really loves her father, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
quick brain and skilful fingers are active
in his service. Her love has made her
forget herself entirely&mdash;for a time.</p>

<p>It is her hands that arrange a pillow
under the injured knee supporting it in
such a manner that the pain is greatly
lessened. It is she who opens the window
to give him air, and brings a cup of hot
milk to relieve his exhaustion. There is
no thinking of herself just now, all her
own little troubles are quite forgotten. Is
there nothing she can do to make her
father's pain easier? That one thought
fills her heart.</p>

<p>The doctor! Betty draws back, breathless
with anxiety. Will father groan again
when the doctor touches him?</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Lord, do make the pain
better!" she murmurs, with pale lips. It
is the first time she has really prayed from
her heart of hearts for anyone save herself.</p>

<p>"I was hurrying along, and slipped upon
a banana skin, falling with a crash to the
pavement, and striking my knee smartly
against the edge of the curb-stone," she
hears father explain to the doctor.</p>

<p>"Ah, 'more haste less speed' this time,
with a vengeance, Mr. Langdale. It's a
pity you weren't more careful."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's my girl's birthday, and I had
only just remembered it," murmurs father
faintly. Oh, how poor Betty's conscience
pricks her as she hears the words!</p>

<p>"Hem! bad job; bad job. A pair of
sharp scissors, my dear," and the doctor
turns to Betty, who flies to get them.</p>

<p>The doctor cuts away the clothing from
the injured knee, and after a very brief
examination declares that his patient must
be taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>"I will send an ambulance for you immediately,
Mr. Langdale. There is no help
for it, I am afraid," he says, and takes his
leave.</p>

<p>There is another dreadful interval of waiting.
Mother continues to sob and rock
herself to and fro. Bob takes up his stand
by the window, on the look-out for the
ambulance. He is truly sorry for father,
yet, boy-like, feels all the painful importance
of the position.</p>

<p>But Betty holds her father's hand, with
eyes brimful of pitying love.</p>

<p>"Father, father," she whispers, "if I
could only help you; if I could only bear
some of the pain for you."</p>

<p>A faint smile flickers into his face, and
the set features relax a little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear you will have to bear your share,
my lass. The pain in my knee is nothing
to having to leave you all to shift for yourselves.
You must see Mr. Duncan, the
landlord of the houses I collect rents for,
the first thing to-morrow, and take him the
rent-books. You'll find them all in my
bag, and the money I've collected this
week, too. I haven't got it all yet. Perhaps
he'll do something for your mother while
I'm laid by; I don't know. Oh, Betty, my
girl, I must leave so much in your hands.
Do all you can for your mother. Try your
best to keep the home together."</p>

<p>"Father, I'll try so hard. I'll do everything
I can. I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here's the ambulance, and there's a
nurse and two men getting out," announces
Bob from the window.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langdale's sobs rise into screams,
but Betty scarcely hears her; just now she
has eyes and ears for her father alone.</p>

<p>Skilful hands carry him to the ambulance,
and this time no groan reaches Betty's
straining ears, as she follows the party.</p>

<p>"Go to your mother! She needs you,
and I am in good hands. God bless you,
dear child! God be with you and help you!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>FOR FATHER'S SAKE</h3>


<p>Betty stands gazing at the ambulance, as
it passes steadily out of sight, and a feeling
of deep loneliness sweeps over her heart.
No one loves her, no one understands her
as father does, and now he has gone from
her.</p>

<p>"Ah! there I am, thinking about myself
again&mdash;I <i>won't</i> do it!"</p>

<p>She rouses herself with a brave effort,
and goes back into the house.</p>

<p>A house full of noise and confusion just
now. Mother sobbing loudly in the little
sitting-room. Jennie and Pollie, awakened
from sleep, shrieking themselves hoarse in
their bedroom above. Clara helpless; Bob
dazed-looking; Lucy tearful. Only Betty
still manages to keep her wits about her.</p>

<p>"Lucy, run upstairs and quiet the children&mdash;mother,
mother, you mustn't upset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
yourself so&mdash;father will soon be better, I'm
sure&mdash;such a nice, sweet nurse came to
look after him. Come, mother, you're quite
tired out; lie down on the sofa, and I'll
make you a cup of tea."</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do? What shall I
do?" moans Mrs. Langdale.</p>

<p>"Father will soon be in less pain,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what shall <i>I</i> do? Most likely he'll
never be able to walk again. Mr. Duncan
will get some one else to collect his rents
and look after the houses, and we shall all
starve."</p>

<p>"Mother, you really must not worry
about all that to-night. Father told me to
go and see Mr. Duncan to-morrow, and
perhaps he'll do something for us."</p>

<p>"Mr. Duncan do anything? Why, he's
as hard as flint, always grumbling at your
father for not getting the last penny out of
the tenants; <i>he</i> do anything? Oh, no, no!"</p>

<p>"Well, we don't know how it will be
yet. Come, mother, I'm going to make
you that cup of tea, and you must lie down
while I get it."</p>

<p>Betty makes the tea, and coaxes her
mother into taking it, and presently persuades
her to go to bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very late by this time, the house is
quiet, and Betty goes to bed herself.</p>

<p>Now, at last, in the silence, she has time
to think.</p>

<p>This morning&mdash;was it really only this
morning that she was so foolishly vexed
because her birthday was not remembered?
Did she really feel the sweep's visit a big
trouble only a few hours ago? How small,
how utterly insignificant her troubles have
been up to now! And yet she has made
so much of them, has felt herself so hardly
used!</p>

<p>For a long time she lies awake, turning
it all over in her mind. "Father, dear,
patient old father is tossing in pain and
fever, and his worry is much worse than
mine, for he must lie still and think, and I
can be up and at work. It is so much
harder to bear things when you can do
nothing to make them better. Lord, show
me what to do; show me how to work for
our home&mdash;for father's sake."</p>

<p>Somehow, soon after that prayer, Betty
falls into a sound sleep, and does not awake
until it is morning.</p>

<p>When at length she opens her eyes, it is
time to get up. For a moment she lies
still enough, not remembering what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
happened; then, with a rush, it all comes
back to her, and she starts out of bed.</p>

<p>Father, mother, children&mdash;what can she
do for them all? Last night she had no
answer to that question, but now a bright,
a daring hope has flashed into her mind.
Why shouldn't <i>she</i> collect Mr. Duncan's
rents, and keep his accounts whilst father
is laid by? She wanted to go out to work
for herself. Here is the chance of doing
something much better, of working for
father's sake, of lifting a great part of this
heavy load from his heart!</p>

<p>But can she do it&mdash;can she? Her heart
sinks again. "Oh, will Mr. Duncan give
me a trial?" Suddenly she remembers
Grannie. "How sorry Grannie will be for
this&mdash;Oh, if I were like Grannie how much
easier it would be! Let me think, if Grannie
was in my place, what would she do first?"</p>

<p>The answer to that question is easy
enough. "She would pray."</p>

<p>Betty kneels by the bedside. She prays
for her father, and then she prays for herself;
prays that she may have strength
given her, and wisdom, and courage, to do
her work bravely and well.</p>

<p>Mother is quite unfit for anything this
morning. Lucy must give up her music-lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to wait on her. The children are
very fretful. Clara declares she is "too
much upset to do her usual work, and it
ought not to be expected of her."</p>

<p>Only Betty is patient and gentle, striving
to get through the usual duties. Love is
leading her at last&mdash;love for her father. Just
now no thought of self dims her memory
of his suffering face.</p>

<p>But for all that her heart beats very fast,
when at last she knocks at Mr. Duncan's
door, and her grand plan of carrying on a
part of dear father's work suddenly appears
quite hopeless.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it will make Mr. Duncan
quite angry to propose such a thing. Had
not I better just give him the money father
collected, and say nothing about my idea
after all?" Betty hesitates a moment,
then&mdash;</p>

<p>"For father's sake&mdash;for father's sake,"
she murmurs to herself.</p>

<p>The door is opened by a neat maid. Yes,
Mr. Duncan is at home, will she please to
give her name? Another minute and she
is shown into a room, where an elderly
gentleman is writing at a table.</p>

<p>"The young person to see you, sir,"
announces the maid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The elderly gentleman looks up with a
frown, and fixes a pair of hard grey eyes
on her face.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the meaning of this?"
he says gruffly. "Where's your father?"</p>

<p>Betty pauses a moment.</p>

<p>"Where's your father? I want to see
him particularly," repeats Mr. Duncan,
still more angrily.</p>

<p>Betty quakes inwardly; but her courage
is of the kind that always rises at an
emergency, and she explains what has
happened in a clear business-like fashion.</p>

<p>"Hem! accident indeed&mdash;pretty fix his
accident has left me in," grumbles Mr.
Duncan, when she has finished. "Have
you the money with you?"</p>

<p>Betty produces it. He counts it over.
"Why, how's this? There's two pounds
short!"</p>

<p>"Father was to collect that to-day, sir;
there's a note in his book saying which of
the tenants haven't paid yet."</p>

<p>"Hem! bad system. If they can't pay
up to time, they ought to go. And what
am I to do now, pray?"</p>

<p>"Please, if you'll let me, I'll go round
to the tenants in father's place," cries
Betty, eagerly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"You? Why, what does a girl like you
know about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm good at accounts; and father has
told me how it is done, and shown me the
books&mdash;I help him with them sometimes.
If you would <i>only</i> let me try, sir&mdash;until
father gets better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it? <i>You</i> want to take
over my work!" and, rather to Betty's surprise,
the hard old eyes give a little twinkle
of amusement. "No&mdash;no, my girl, you
don't understand; there's a great deal
besides just collecting the money. Repairs
to attend to; bad tenants to get rid of; new
tenants to bargain with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, sir," interrupts Betty, eagerly, "if
you would only let me try to do the best
I can until father comes out of the hospital&mdash;perhaps
the repairs could wait&mdash;and I'd
try <i>so</i> hard; and&mdash;and we've nothing but
a few pounds in the savings bank, and
father said he thought you might do something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, he did&mdash;did he? Very kind of
him, I'm sure!" snaps Mr. Duncan, the
hard, suspicious look returning to his face.</p>

<p>Betty feels ready to burst into tears. "He
thinks the very idea of employing me utterly
absurd," she thinks, and turns to go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>But hardly have her fingers touched the
handle, before Mr. Duncan calls her back.</p>

<p>"Don't be in such a hurry, young
person. Your father is a great deal too
soft with the tenants; but I believe he
means well, and I'm sorry for his accident.
Suppose you go round to the tenants who
haven't paid this morning? It will be time
enough to talk about your taking on the
work when I see what you can do."</p>

<p>She is to have a trial after all! The
expression on Betty's face changes so
quickly, that Mr. Duncan's eyes twinkle
again.</p>

<p>"Hem! you needn't look so pleased. I
don't promise anything, mind&mdash;why, bless
the girl, if she isn't off already! Well, if
she takes after her father, I might do
worse. Soft-hearted&mdash;a great deal too soft-hearted&mdash;but
as honest as the day," and
the old gentleman returns to his writing.</p>

<p>Betty hurries home for her father's little
rent-collecting bag; and then makes her
way through the network of narrow streets,
in the midst of which the houses owned by
Mr. Duncan stand.</p>

<p>Arriving at the long row, she looks round
her in some dismay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i075.png" width="351" height="600" alt="&quot;Rent?&quot; cries the woman bitterly." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Rent?&quot; cries the woman bitterly.</span>
</div>

<p>How small the houses are&mdash;how dirty!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
How narrow and wretched-looking the
street!</p>

<p>She consults her list, and knocks timidly
at the door of the first number. No answer.
She knocks again. A shuffling of feet
follows, and presently a woman appears.
She is haggard and old-looking, and the
child in her arms is wailing pitifully. A
second child clings to her skirt, and mother
and children alike are wretchedly clad.</p>

<p>"Rent?" cries the woman bitterly, in
answer to Betty's timid request. "Pray,
how do you suppose I'm to pay the rent,
and my husband still on the drink? I told
the agent it was no use calling, and if he
wants to turn me out, he must!"</p>

<p>And without giving Betty time to answer,
she drags the children in, and slams the
door.</p>

<p>Betty has not the courage to knock
again. What a glimpse of dull, hopeless
misery the woman's face and voice have
revealed to her! She passes on to the next
house.</p>

<p>The woman who answers this door is
rather cleaner. "Called for the rent?
But you're not the agent," she says,
looking at Betty very suspiciously.</p>

<p>Betty explains. "Hum! I don't like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
look of it. How do I know it's all right?
There, you needn't look so offended. If
<i>you</i> had had to work early and late, denying
yourself your proper rest, and a bit of
butter to your bread, to make up the rent,
you'd be careful who you trusted it with, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>Betty shows the poor woman her father's
collecting book, and after a while the rent
is put grudgingly into her hands. Betty
cannot bear to take it from the poor thing.</p>

<p>It is a slow, miserable business, but
before the morning is over Betty manages
to get the greater part of the two pounds
together.</p>

<p>"Hem; short, as usual," is Mr. Duncan's
discouraging remark, as he counts it over.</p>

<p>Betty feels sick at heart. The morning's
work has been quite a new experience.
Occupied only with her own thoughts and
plans, she has thought very little about
other people's difficulties; and the miserable
homes she has just seen have shocked
and pained her deeply.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan weighs the money in his
hand for a moment or two, as though
considering.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't be bothered just now with
looking up anyone else. I suppose we'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
better go on as we are&mdash;for the present.
Here's the whole rent account-book; take
it home, and let me know how much rent
I've lost on the half-year. Good morning."</p>

<p>So she is to take up part of father's
work, after all! How glad dear father
will be!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>DAY BY DAY</h3>


<p>For the first time in her life Betty is
glad to be at home. The rooms seem more
comfortable and airy than they have ever
done before.</p>

<p>"Oh, how thankful I am that I don't
live in that horrid, narrow street, like those
poor wretched-looking women and children!"
she thinks. Even one morning's work
among people so much worse off than herself
has opened her eyes a little to the
blessings she possesses in her home.</p>

<p>Why, if father were only coming home
as usual to-night, she could feel almost
happy&mdash;<i>if</i>&mdash;ah! but father is not coming
home; yet he will come some day, his life
is in no danger. Oh, she will be brave for
his sake, she will be true to the trust he
has left in her hands!</p>

<p>No dinner ready again; mother still quite
incapable of attending to anything, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
poor Betty thoroughly tired out with her
anxious morning's work. Yet she is not
even cross.</p>

<p>No, the more trying and difficult things
are, the greater the victory; and just now
she feels braced up, heart and soul, for the
fight.</p>

<p>It is sometimes easier to be brave and
unselfish in a time of real trouble, than to
bear with patience and sweetness the little
worries of everyday life.</p>

<p>But Betty is on the right road now, she
is doing great things; she is marching
straight on; she is opening her heart to the
Lord, and allowing His light to shine into
its dark places, and there is hope that
before the little, wearing everyday worries
come back again, she may be strong
enough to resist even them, and prove
herself a true Soldier at last.</p>

<p>She may fail though, and darken the
light that God sends her! Well, we will
hope for better things.</p>

<p>So Betty bustles about, and has dinner
ready as usual when the children come in.
Not until they are all off to school again
has she time to tell her mother of the
morning's work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Langdale is not at all encouraging.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nice place to send a girl like you to.
What is he going to pay you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet, mother."</p>

<p>"And you never thought of asking?
You silly child! He'll take your work and
give you nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure he wouldn't do that,
mother." But she looks rather blank at the
idea.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll see; and don't say I didn't
warn you. When are you going to see
Mr. Duncan again?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow. I'm to make out an
account of the rents to-night, and take it
with me."</p>

<p>Betty finds that this last is easier said
than done. She pores over the books until
her head aches. Presently Bob comes in.</p>

<p>"Here, Betty, look sharp. I want a
button sewn on my coat, and I can't find
that new pair of boot-laces, and&mdash;why, just
fancy sitting there reading like that! No
wonder a fellow can never get anything
done in this house&mdash;it's too bad!"</p>

<p>"I'm not reading, I'm doing Mr.
Duncan's accounts," says Betty quietly.
The knowledge that she is working unselfishly
for the good of her family is a grand
help towards keeping her temper!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob stares. "Rubbish!" he says.</p>

<p>"Come and see, Bob. I'm to do part of
father's work, and Oh, I do wish you could
help me. I feel so stupid to-night, and
there is so much to do."</p>

<p>Bob melts at once. "Why, Bet, who
would have thought of your doing such a
thing? There, let me see&mdash;Ah, here we
are! Now then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But, alas! just as Bob is beginning to
bring his brand-new ideas of correct book-keeping
to bear on the problem before
them, a violent outcry arises from Pollie,
who, until now, has been playing fairly
quietly with Jennie in the corner.</p>

<p>"Harry, you bad, wicked boy!" she
screams, "I'll pull all your hair out, that
I will!" and she rushes at Harry like a
little fury. Harry defends himself savagely,
and Jennie, curled up on the floor, howls
her loudest.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Jennie! Pollie and Harry,
if you don't leave off fighting at once, I'll
box your ears all round!" cries Bob, looking
up angrily from his work.</p>

<p>"Harry's sawn the leg off one of our
dollies!" shrieks Pollie, "and he's a bad,
bad, wicked boy!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

I was the doctor, and had to take it off."</p>

<p>"He hadn't! He was to cure its bad
leg, and now he's made it worse, and I'll
pull his hair out for that, I will!"</p>

<p>"I don't care about your old dolls and
rubbish; but if you're not quiet this minute
I'll knock all your heads together and give
you something to cry for!" cries Bob, still
more angrily, and he starts from his chair
as though to execute his threat.</p>

<p>But Betty lays her hand entreatingly on
his arm. "Oh, Bob, don't; father wouldn't
like it. He can't bear you to strike the
children. Pollie, perhaps the doll can be
mended; Harry didn't mean any harm.
Harry, be quiet, you must not beat your
little sister. Pollie, leave go, you naughty
girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Betty is powerless to stop the storm.
Bob tries to separate Harry and Pollie, who
are fighting desperately. Harry kicks at
Bob, whereat the elder brother loses his
temper altogether, and cuffs Harry vigorously
on both sides of his head. Harry
roars; Jennie and Pollie continue to shriek.
Bob, his face flaming with wrath, drags
each screaming, kicking child to the door,
and flings it into the passage. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
locks the door, and with flushed face and
tumbled hair, though pretending to look
quite unconcerned, goes on with the books,
in spite of the yells from the passage
outside.</p>

<p>Betty is in despair.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, how could you be so violent?
If father had been at home you would not
have behaved so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Betty, if you're going to
begin that, you may take the books yourself
and do them; I'm sick of the whole
thing!"</p>

<p>Betty is wise enough to make no answer
to Bob's outburst. She leaves the room
quietly, and, after some trouble, pacifies
the children, and sees them all safely in bed.</p>

<p>She feels thoroughly humiliated and
miserable. The whole thing is such a keen
disgrace; that <i>her</i> brothers and sisters
should behave so roughly and rudely!</p>

<p>How untrained they all are&mdash;how badly
brought up! No wonder father has grown
so sad and old-looking of late. His old
home&mdash;when he lived with Grannie&mdash;must
have been very different.</p>

<p>She returns to the accounts. Bob is still
poring over them, but looks so savage that
she is almost afraid to speak. He finishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the work in silence, answers her thanks
with a grunt, and goes off with his head in
the air, and both hands deep in his pockets.</p>

<p>And Betty goes to bed herself, depressed
indeed.</p>

<p>But the next morning there is a short
pencil-note from father. His knee is more
comfortable, but the doctor fears it will be
a long business. He is most anxious to
hear what Mr. Duncan will do.</p>

<p>Reading the note to mother, who is not
up yet, makes Betty rather later than usual,
and she runs straight to the kitchen to
hurry on the breakfast.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clara, the kettle not boiling yet,
nor the porridge on&mdash;why, this is too bad!
You are more behindhand than ever. Pray,
how does this happen?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," mutters Clara, sulkily.</p>

<p>"But you ought to know. Come, make
haste&mdash;a bundle of wood, quick! The
children must leave in half an hour."</p>

<p>Betty bustles about, and manages to get
some sort of meal ready in time.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, and the children gone to
school, she returns to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Things cannot be allowed to go on like
this. She must talk to Clara.</p>

<p>But what can she say? Clara is so used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to scolding, that she cares nothing for it.
No, she must try to reason with her; she
must teach her to think.</p>

<p>Wise Betty! Perplexed and troubled,
she turns into the now deserted sitting-room
for a few moments, and asks the Lord
to help her. Then she goes back.</p>

<p>"Clara," she begins, "I have to go out
this morning to look after some of father's
business. I shall have to go out a good
deal, for the work must be done, and is
not easy to do; indeed, I can't do it at all
unless you help me."</p>

<p>Clara opens her eyes very wide at this.</p>

<p>"I see you wonder what I mean. You
must help me by getting all your work
nicely forward, and the dinner prepared
before I get back. Now, just look at this
kitchen; I don't believe it's been swept
since the day before yesterday; has it,
Clara?"</p>

<p>Clara is silent; and begins biting the
corner of her apron sulkily.</p>

<p>"Why are you neglecting everything in
this way? Come, answer me, Clara."</p>

<p>"Don't know; I'm upset, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"Well, what has upset you?"</p>

<p>"Master's accident, of course. I wouldn't
care a bit if it was some folks&mdash;serve them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
right! But master, who never speaks a
cross word to anyone, and always asks after
mother&mdash;that it should happen to him! It
isn't fair! I don't see what is to prevent
<i>any</i> of us getting our legs broken if he is
to be smashed up in this way; and I'm that
upset, I can't seem to settle to anything."</p>

<p>"But that is just what we've all got to
learn to do&mdash;for father's sake. And, Clara,
I think God has sent us this trouble because
we have all been so careless and thankless
in the past. You've never really cared to
do your work properly, I'm afraid; you've
never felt any real responsibility about
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, how can you say that? I'm always
at work, and never, never done!"</p>

<p>"That's just because you never think
about your work; you don't ever take the
trouble to arrange it; and you don't care a
bit about neatness or cleanliness."</p>

<p>Clara raises the corner of the dirty
apron from her mouth to her eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the good?" she whimpers. "I
should get in a muddle again directly; my
work isn't anything <i>but</i> muddle!"</p>

<p>"But that's what it shouldn't be. You
do your work as though you thought it
wasn't worth doing at all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't think about it at all," mutters
Clara.</p>

<p>"That's just it. My Grannie, she keeps
her house as clean and tidy as a new pin,
and yet always has time for everything.
My Grannie says that all work is really
beautiful if it is done for God. Did you
never hear of the little servant who used
to say she swept the floor for God, and
cleaned the pots for God, too? God sees
everything, you know.</p>

<p>"Then, again, you're sorry for father's
accident; but why don't you show you're
sorry by doing your work in the way father
would like? Untidy rooms and careless,
slipshod ways worry him dreadfully. Now,
wouldn't it be nice if we could get all the
house in apple-pie order, and ourselves into
nice, tidy ways, before he comes out of the
hospital? What a smile of thanks he would
give us all round! Come, isn't that something
worth trying for?"</p>

<p>"Hum! Don't see how it's going to be
done," mutters Clara, looking round the
untidy kitchen hopelessly. "We're just in
a muddle everywhere."</p>

<p>"We can't get straight all of a minute,
of course. But what I want us to do is to
make a beginning. Ah, there's ten o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
striking! I must go to Mr. Duncan with
the books. Now, you will try&mdash;won't you,
Clara? You'll work for God, and to please
father, and to help me; and, Clara," adds
Betty, in a hurried whisper, "<i>do</i> run
upstairs and put your cap straight, and
wash that great black smut from your face&mdash;it's
right across your nose."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE CAPTAIN</h3>


<p>Mr. Duncan offers to give Betty a third
part of her father's usual earnings. The
rent-collecting will occupy three long mornings
in the week at least, and an hour or
two of every evening must be spent over
the books.</p>

<p>The sights and sounds of the district she
has to collect for trouble Betty dreadfully.
Some of the women look utterly weary and
down-trodden; others again are always
scolding and quarrelling. Then the poor,
sickly children&mdash;and occasional glimpses of
rough, drink-sodden men&mdash;haunt her mind.
She has over a hundred houses to collect
for, and it takes her the whole of the three
mornings to get through them all.</p>

<p>How many stories of want and misery
she has listened to before the week's work
is over!</p>

<p>"My husband has taken to the drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
again." "My father was knocked down
by a van and carried to the hospital."
"The children have all got the measles."
"Mother's taken bad with bronchitis."
"My husband hasn't done a stroke of work
for three weeks." Are all the stories true?
Betty has no means of knowing.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, she returns home and
throws herself into a chair after each morning's
work. A shabby, untidy room? Well,
perhaps it is; but, Oh! how different from
the homes she has just visited! How
wrong she has been to grumble so in the
past&mdash;how wicked to be discontented!</p>

<p>One day she returns in a specially humble
frame of mind.</p>

<p>"My home could be made a really beautiful
one if I only knew how to manage.
But I don't. I'm very stupid, somehow.
I try and try, but never seem to know what
to do for the best.</p>

<p>"Have I made any difference at all,
since I came home from Grannie's?</p>

<p>"Clara is a little better, perhaps&mdash;at
least, her face is a shade cleaner; and I
didn't notice more than two saucepans
standing about, and&mdash;Oh! yes, the kettle
was boiling this morning&mdash;I mustn't forget
all that; but how rough the children are!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
How unreasonable Bob is at times! Two
or three evenings he has stayed out quite
late. Father wouldn't like that&mdash;I wonder
where he goes? Then, there's Lucy;
nothing in the home seems to interest her.
I do think it very selfish of her to spend so
much time in reading, especially just now.</p>

<p>"When I first returned home, I thought
everything was wrong; now I can see it
isn't the home so much, it's the people in
it. We're all spoiling it&mdash;and I'm helping
to spoil it as well.</p>

<p>"What grand thoughts I had about
making everything right all at once, and
what a little I seem likely to do!"</p>

<p>All day Betty goes about her work in the
same humble spirit, with a sense of failure
strong upon her.</p>

<p>The excitement of father's accident is
over now; they have settled down into their
old grooves again. True, Betty has much
extra work to do, but all the glory of
fighting grand difficulties has died out of
her life again.</p>

<p>Collecting rents is certainly a very
depressing business; that is, in a poor,
unthrifty neighbourhood. No, there is
nothing splendid about it.</p>

<p>"The house is as untidy as ever," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thinks, "and the younger children so rude
and boisterous&mdash;and mother doesn't seem
to care a bit."</p>

<p>Lower sink Betty's spirits as the day
wears on. Now, is the real time of trial;
now, indeed, she needs all her courage and
resolution.</p>

<p>A letter from Grannie! Two letters&mdash;one
to mother about father's accident, and
a long loving letter of good counsel to
herself.</p>

<p>Betty carries her treasure away to her
own room; a few sprigs of fresh lavender
fall from between the folded pages as she
opens it. How Grannie's rooms always
smelt of lavender! Her eyes fill with tears
at the memories the delicate scent recalls to
her mind!</p>

<p>"How lovingly Grannie's letter begins!
Ah, she doesn't know what a failure I am
making of everything!" thinks poor Betty.</p>

<p>"What is this? What does Grannie
say?" Betty gazes eagerly at the page.
"Oh! how did she guess all this?"</p>

<p>"I know, dear, that this is a time of real
fighting," so the letter runs; "that every
day brings its hard battle&mdash;the battle of
standing firm against the worry and irritation
of little things." Betty sighs. "Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and I feel sure that every day sees a hard-won
victory, too." Betty shakes her head,
and one big tear steals slowly down her
cheek.</p>

<p>"You have written very little about
yourself lately, but I can see from your
mother's letters, and from your own, too,
that the Bird of Love is beginning to speak
in your voice; that my dear Betty is letting
the Lord Jesus rule in her heart.</p>

<p>"You have much to learn yet, dear, and
little to help you to learn it. Can you not
go to The Army Meetings? I hear that
Captain Janet Scott, a dear young friend
of mine, has just gone in charge of the
Corps in Duke Street. I have written to
her about you. Do ask your mother's
leave to go to the Meetings."</p>

<p>"O Grannie, I should so love to go,"
murmurs Betty; "but I am afraid&mdash;I'm
quite sure&mdash;mother would never let me, even
if I asked her!"</p>

<p>"Go on fighting bravely, dear; do not
allow these little troubles to wear away
your courage. Trust the Lord more and
more. Lean on Him; fight in His strength,
and a bright day of victory will dawn for
you at last. Ah, Betty, it is dawning for
you now! Already the true, unselfish love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
that will make you a happy girl is beginning
to shine in your heart."</p>

<p>"Oh! how <i>can</i> she say that?" and the
tears that sparkle in Betty's eyes now are
tears of joy. "Can that really be true?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I knew mother wouldn't let me go to
The Army Meetings&mdash;I was perfectly <i>sure</i>
of it!" exclaims Betty to herself the morning
after Grannie's letter. Her eyes are
heavy with trouble again, her heart sore
with painful recollections. She has asked
for permission, and been refused, and the
words of mother's refusal have been hard
to bear.</p>

<p>"How can she be so unjust, so unreasonable?"
thinks Betty, angrily, as she enters
the crowded district where Mr. Duncan's
property lies, for she is rent-collecting
again.</p>

<p>Grannie's letter had cheered her for
awhile, but the talk with mother this morning
has plunged her again into the depths
of gloom. Just now everything seems dark
and sad indeed.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I've the same dreary round
of calls to make, I suppose, the same unhappiness
to see everywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a dreadful amount of trouble
there is in this world, and there doesn't
seem to be any way of making things
better. No. 41. Oh, yes; the woman here
has a tiny, tiny baby, and she's very weak
and wretched, and there's a whole troop of
dirty, rough-haired little children, with no
one to look after them. I can't bear to
knock&mdash;how can she pay anything? Well,
I suppose I must."</p>

<p>"Come in&mdash;the door is unbolted!" cries
a cheery voice, in answer to her knock&mdash;a
very different voice from that she had
expected to hear.</p>

<p>Betty steps reluctantly into the passage.</p>

<p>"What is it you want, please?" says the
voice again, from a room at the back.
Betty explains her business wonderingly;
the voice is so unlike the dull, hopeless
tones with which she is usually greeted.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, Captain," says a
second voice, far more feebly, "it's the
young lady for the rent."</p>

<p>"Do come in please, and excuse me just
a moment, as I can't leave the child like
this," cries the cheery voice.</p>

<p>Whereat Betty steps to the door and
peeps in.</p>

<p>Round a big empty packing-case, placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in the centre of the room, the tenant's
three children are gathered.</p>

<p>The little boy, his face shining with
cleanliness, and his usually tousled head
smooth and glossy, is looking on, whilst a
sweet-faced woman, in a blue serge dress
and big apron, is washing one of his sisters
in a large basin, with a plentiful supply of
soap and water.</p>

<p>On the floor sits a third child awaiting
her turn; and on the bed in the corner lies
the sick woman, her baby on her arm, and
such a hopeful expression on her face that
Betty scarcely recognises her.</p>

<p>"Come in, miss," she says, "I've got
a bit of rent for you this week, thanks to
Captain helping my husband to some work.
Here it is," and she pulls a few shillings,
wrapped in a scrap of paper, from under
her pillow.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Smith," says Betty.
"That is the Captain, I suppose?" she
adds, glancing towards the washing operations
going on in the middle of the room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/i099.png" width="348" height="600" alt="A plentiful supply of soap and water." title="" />
<span class="caption">A plentiful supply of soap and water.</span>
</div>

<p>"Bless her! yes," answers Mrs. Smith,
in a low voice. "And an angel from the
Lord she's been to me, miss. Washed the
children regular, tidied up, made my bit of
gruel, given the children their dinners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and, what's better than all, she put fresh
heart in me, miss, with her beautiful
prayers and pleadings. Last week I felt
that I wanted to give up and die. Oh, the
Lord is good to send me such a friend!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mrs. Smith, the Lord is
always good to those who trust Him," interposes
the Captain, who has overheard
the last remark.</p>

<p>Is this Captain Janet Scott&mdash;Grannie's
friend? Betty must know, and stands
waiting until the washing is finished, and
the Captain puts on her bonnet to go.</p>

<p>They pass out of the house together, but
a sudden shyness has come over Betty, and
she quite stammers as she says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please, are you Captain Janet Scott?"</p>

<p>The Captain gives her a bright look.
"Yes; and who are you&mdash;one of my
Soldiers? I hoped so directly I saw you."</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;that is, I'd like to be&mdash;only I'm
afraid I mustn't," stammers Betty.</p>

<p>"Mustn't be a Soldier? How's that, my
child?"</p>

<p>"I'm Betty Langdale. You know my
Grannie&mdash;she lives near Moordale. She's
a Salvationist, but mother won't let me be
one. I've tried to persuade her only this
morning to say yes, but it's no use."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Betty Langdale&mdash;of course! I'm so
glad to see you, dear, and you can be a
Soldier, even if the way is not yet open
for you to be sworn-in. You can be the
Lord's true Soldier, fighting His battles in
His strength."</p>

<p>"But mother says she will never let me
go to the Meetings."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, dear; but keep believing,
and remember that Meetings alone do not
make good Soldiers. God will help you to
fight your battles at home. Fight against
wrong wherever you see it. Keep very close
to Jesus. Do all you can for those at
home, and you can be a true Salvationist,
although at present you may not join The
Army."</p>

<p>"But mother ought <i>not</i> to stop me
from attending the Meetings, ought she,
Captain?"</p>

<p>"My dear, it is not your place to judge
your mother. Your whole thought should
be to win her gently, to <i>prove</i> to her your
sincerity by your life.</p>

<p>"It is only by keeping things in their
places, you know, that we have a tidy
house. It is only through giving each
member of our family his or her true place
that we can have a happy home. Keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
true and patient, and God Himself will
one day open the door for you.</p>

<p>"Trust Him, commit your life into His
hands, and He will undertake for you and
make the crooked places smooth.</p>

<p>"I have to call here, my child; but we
shall meet again soon, and meantime God
bless and help you every day."</p>

<p>And with a bright smile and warm
handshake, Captain Janet Scott goes on
her way, leaving Betty with a heart filled
with joy. It was surely God Himself who
planned that she should meet the Captain
in this unexpected way, God who had sent
His own sweet messenger to Betty to give
her this much-needed counsel and advice!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>A PLACE FOR EVERY ONE</h3>


<p>"Every one has a right place," thinks
Betty, when her morning's work is done.
"Yes, that sounds true enough, but how
am I to manage in our house? I wish
Captain had explained more about it.</p>

<p>"Now, let me think&mdash;what is my right
place? It is my place to be loving and
thoughtful, to strive to help every one,
that's what Grannie would say. Well, I
am trying to do that. 'It is <i>not</i> your
place to judge your mother,' so said my
dear Captain. Of course, it is not. I
know that, and yet I suppose that is just
what I was doing when I spoke so impatiently
about her. Mother's place?
Have I ever given mother her right place?
Have I ever been really loving, really
thoughtful for her, really obedient?</p>

<p>"But, then, mother has such old-fashioned
notions, and such unpunctual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
ways, and&mdash;no, I <i>won't</i> go on; I mustn't
think these thoughts&mdash;this isn't giving
mother her true place, this isn't keeping
to the spirit of Captain's words!</p>

<p>"How sweet Captain is! Her big brown
eyes are as clear and kind as Grannie's,
and her voice is just the nicest I have ever
heard. How I should love to be like her,
to make all that difference when I went
into a miserable house! Poor Mrs. Smith
looked quite bright; and such a change in
the children! If I could be an Officer,
now, and go about making people happy,
how delightful that would be!"</p>

<p>Then, with a new and true humility that
is only just beginning to make itself felt
in her heart, she adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! but I'm not good enough. I'm
too impatient, too irritable. No, no, I
haven't learnt yet to be a good Soldier&mdash;why,
I haven't learnt yet how to make <i>one</i>
home happy. I must learn to serve with
patience. I must conquer myself; then,
perhaps, in the days to come, the Lord will
open the way to me, and I, too, may go
into sad homes as a messenger of peace
and love."</p>

<p>"Betty!" Mother's voice, calling querulously
from the first-floor landing. Betty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
runs upstairs. Mother has a shawl round
her shoulders, and looks very gloomy and
upset.</p>

<p>"Betty, can't you keep the children
quiet? My head aches dreadfully, but it's
quite useless to try and get any sleep with
Jennie and Pollie stamping about just over
one's head. I sent them up to the attic
to be out of the way, and they've done
nothing but quarrel ever since&mdash;tiresome
little good-for-nothings!"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, they must come down
at once, mother. Shall I send them out for
a walk?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, they're so dreadfully rough,
throwing stones and shouting themselves
hoarse like a couple of street boys. I don't
know what I've done, I'm sure, to have
such troublesome children."</p>

<p>Betty fetches her two younger sisters
down from the attic, and sends them out
to play in the small garden-yard at the
back of the house. She has a great deal of
difficulty, for they are both so headstrong
and unruly that they will hardly obey at
all. At last she persuades them to settle
down to a game of horses, and goes back.</p>

<p>But five minutes have barely elapsed
when mother's voice is heard again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Betty, what are those children doing?
I declare their noise is making me quite ill!"</p>

<p>Dismal shrieks from the back of the house
confirm her words. Betty flies to a window
and looks out.</p>

<p>Pollie, screaming with terror, is flying
from Jennie, who, with face distorted with
passion, is darting after her&mdash;flourishing a
big stick, and yelling like a mad girl.</p>

<p>Betty's heart sinks at the sight. How
shameful, how humiliating that her sisters
should behave like this! How untaught
and untrained they are!</p>

<p>She runs out breathlessly. She seizes
Jennie by the arm. Jennie kicks and
screams furiously.</p>

<p>"I will whip her, I will! She's a bad,
wicked girl. She said she would stand still
if I would let go of her arm, and then she
ran away!"</p>

<p>"'Cos she was going to put a big strap
in my mouth, and drive me about," sobs
Pollie, "and I won't have it, I won't!"
and, relying on Betty's protection, she
strikes at her sister in her turn.</p>

<span class="caption">Pollie flying from Jennie.</span>
</div>

<p>"Pollie! Jennie! Oh, how can you
behave so badly? You rude, naughty
girls! Why, you're every bit as bad as
the rough boys who play in the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Aren't you ashamed to behave so wickedly?
Don't you know that the Lord is very sorry
when He sees little girls selfish, and rude,
and passionate? You know quite well that
poor mother's head is bad, and yet you
make all this noise! Why don't you try
to play quietly together?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to play at," answers Jennie,
sulkily. "I'm tired of games; and, besides,
games are silly."</p>

<p>"Then take your knitting, or hem one of
the new dusters."</p>

<p>"Shan't; it's holiday time, and I don't
mean to do any work. If Pollie wasn't so
silly I could play with her all right&mdash;screaming
and making all that fuss about
nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't keep quiet, I shall
have to put you to bed&mdash;now remember."</p>

<p>But to herself Betty thinks, "Now, what
would be the right thing to do for them?
Teach them better, I suppose; teach them
to be kind and gentle, teach them to be
unselfish, to think less of themselves and
more of others."</p>

<p>The thought is still with her when she
returns to her household duties. Suddenly
a happy idea strikes her.</p>

<p>"Ah! I remember how Grannie told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that when she was a girl she used to invite
a number of her little school-friends to her
cottage on half-holidays; each girl brought
a small piece of work with her, a tiny petticoat
to sew, a sock to knit, or what not;
and they would sew and chat away happily
for hours, fancying themselves a real sewing
society.</p>

<p>"The work was not for themselves&mdash;Oh,
no! Twice every year all the little garments
were collected and given to the
poorer children of the village. Now, if
these rough, headstrong sisters of mine
would only do that! Is there nothing to
make them follow dear Grannie's example?"</p>

<p>All the rest of that day Betty is thinking
over her plan, and at night, ere she goes
to rest, she lays the whole matter before
the Lord in very earnest prayer. She is
beginning to understand something at last
of the real strength, and comfort, and light,
which follows all heart-felt prayer.</p>

<p>Next morning she awakes with the determination
strong within her of commencing
that very day to win her little sisters to
better things.</p>

<p>The children's summer holidays are just
beginning; now is the time to interest
them, to teach and help them; to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
higher thoughts into their minds, to give
their hands unselfish work to do.</p>

<p>It is a hot afternoon, Jennie and Pollie
have been playing together aimlessly, breaking
out now and again into noisy bursts of
passion. They are too tired to play any
more now, and hot and sulky besides.</p>

<p>Betty calls them to her.</p>

<p>"Jennie, Pollie, I want to talk to you
about a new way of spending your holiday
afternoons; a really beautiful way. Come
into the garden, and I'll tell you all about
it."</p>

<p>The "garden" is only a back-yard, with
one dusty tree leaning over the paling,
and a few unhappy-looking flowers. How
different from Grannie's garden, with its
masses of sweet-scented, old-fashioned blossoms;
its pure air and clear sunlight!</p>

<p>Well, well, Betty must not think of that
just now. At any rate, the air is fresher
here than in the house.</p>

<p>"Is it a new kind of game? Oh, Betty,
do make haste and tell us!"</p>

<p>"Listen, girls. Hundreds and hundreds
of years ago there lived a dear, good woman&mdash;a
<i>very</i> good woman."</p>

<p>"What was her name?" demands Pollie.</p>

<p>"Dorcas. She lived in a little town by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the seaside, in a country far away. Now
in this town were many poor widows, who
could not afford to buy clothes enough to
keep them warm; and when Dorcas saw
this she set to work, and cut out nice coats,
and stitched away, and I daresay she called
her neighbours in to help her, and very
soon those poor widows had new garments
all round. How grateful, how delighted
they were! They couldn't say enough to
show their thanks."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Aren't you just
making it up, Betty?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; we read about Dorcas, and
the poor widows, and their coats, in the
Bible itself. Now, why don't you two girls
invite two or three of your school friends in
one afternoon, and pretend to be Dorcas
and her neighbours? I'll be Dorcas, if you
like, and we'll make little garments for poor
widows and fatherless children, and chat
together, just as Dorcas and her friends
did, hundreds and hundreds of years ago."</p>

<p>"Who'll be the widows?" asked Jennie,
much interested.</p>

<p>"Oh, real widows and orphans; just like
those Dorcas worked for. Then, perhaps,
we could have tea out of doors, and I'll
mix some of those nice buns which Grannie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
showed me how to make. We would drink
our tea out of mugs, because, in the days
when Dorcas lived, no one had cups and
saucers."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be lovely!" cry the
girls. "Who shall we ask to come, Betty?"
adds Jennie alone.</p>

<p>"Anyone you like&mdash;that is, any nice
girl."</p>

<p>"Millie and Ida Davis are both nice as
nice. Then there's Flo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We mustn't have too many at first.
Suppose we each invite one friend? I
choose Minnie White for mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, Minnie White's always so prim
and proper; just because she's an Army
girl; not a bit of fun in her."</p>

<p>"You're quite wrong, Jennie. Minnie is
as full of real fun as she can be. She
doesn't like rough ways, and senseless
jokes; but I only wish you looked one-half
as happy as she does! Well, dears, choose
the best and most unselfish girls you know;
this is to be a very special kind of meeting,
you see."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course; <i>we</i> don't want any
nasty, horrid girls like Kitty and Lena!"</p>

<p>"Now, Jennie, do you think that Dorcas
would <i>ever</i> have been put in the Bible, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
she had talked like that about her friends?
Why, girls, you'll spoil the whole thing if
you don't try to be like her! You're going
to copy her, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Course we are!" assents Pollie.</p>

<p>Betty mixes the cakes that very evening.
She is not a good cook&mdash;does not like
cooking, in fact; but somehow she is feeling
very happy.</p>

<p>"The cakes must be as nice as I can
make them. Ah! I must be sure to take
a peep to-night into that book of father's,
about God's brave Soldiers, in the far-off
days when Dorcas really lived; then I shall
be able to talk about it all to the girls
to-morrow and interest them.</p>

<p>"If I could only help Jennie and Pollie
to understand; if I could really bring them
nearer to the Lord; Oh, what a happy,
what a truly blessed thing that would be!"</p>

<p>The next afternoon is hot again, but there
is shade in the dingy garden. A semicircle
of chairs has been arranged, and Jennie
and Pollie, looking unusually clean and
tidy, with sweet-faced Minnie White, and
Millie and Ida Davis, are industriously
stitching away. It is a critical moment,
for "Dorcas," that is, Betty, has just left
them alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"What horrid clumsy stitches you are
putting in that handkerchief, Pollie," cries
Jennie.</p>

<p>"They're quite as good as yours!" snaps
Pollie.</p>

<p>"They're not!"</p>

<p>"They are! I'm sure they are!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, please don't!" pleads little
Minnie White. "Jennie's stitches are the
best, but then Pollie's are quite as good
for her age. And we must all be very loving
and kind, mustn't we? or we shouldn't be
the least bit like Dorcas and her friends."</p>

<p>Wise Betty to include little Minnie in her
first back-yard meeting!</p>

<p>"Oh, look, here's Betty, I mean Dorcas,
with the tea! How good the cakes smell&mdash;how
thirsty I am! Oh, isn't it just lovely
to have it out here?" cry the girls.</p>

<p>And Jennie and Pollie clap their hands
too, and are as happy as the rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>A QUARREL</h3>


<p>"It has been much easier than I thought,"
says Betty to herself, a week or two after
her first back-yard meeting. The fourth
has just been held, and the girls have taken
to it wonderfully.</p>

<p>"Jennie and Pollie are improving
steadily. How blind I have been! They
were naughty and rough just for want of
some interest in life&mdash;for the need of something
to do. Jennie has hemmed two little
pinafores already, and Pollie one; and the
other girls have all done well&mdash;especially
Minnie White. Ah, Minnie is a darling, a
true Junior Soldier! Her example is just
splendid for my sisters, and I am glad to
see they are getting quite fond of her.
This was a good idea of mine. I must tell
Captain Scott about it. How pleased she
will be! I really am managing much better.
I really am beginning to make home happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and nice. What's that? Seven o'clock,
and the accounts not touched yet! Mr.
Duncan does work me hard. Oh, how glad
I shall be when dear father comes home
again! His leg is really getting stronger
now, that's one comfort. What a grand
day it will be when he leaves the hospital!"</p>

<p>Betty opens the account-books, and sighs
as she looks down the long columns of
figures.</p>

<p>"I only wish Bob would help me as he
did at first. Where does he spend his
evenings? I must say I do think it selfish
of him to be from home so much, considering
everything. Why, I believe that's his
knock now! Perhaps he means to help me
this evening, after all."</p>

<p>And she runs to open the door.</p>

<p>"O Bob, do come and look over the
accounts!" she begins; then, catching sight
of a long black case in his hand, "Why,
Bob, what have you there?"</p>

<p>"Violin," says Bob, briefly, but with an
air of great importance.</p>

<p>"A violin! Dear me, what use can that
be to you?"</p>

<p>"I can learn to play like other people,
I suppose?" answers Bob, tartly. "There,
I haven't time to stand chattering! I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to try this violin to-night, and let the
fellow it belongs to know if it suits me."</p>

<p>"Let what fellow know? O Bob, you
surely haven't promised to <i>buy</i> that old
fiddle?"</p>

<p>"Old fiddle, indeed! Mind your own
business, miss, and leave me to mind mine!"</p>

<p>"I've enough to do, that's certain; and
I suppose now you don't mean to help me
with the accounts one bit?"</p>

<p>Bob only replies to this with a kind of
grunt, and turns into the little front parlour,
where the family generally sit now
that the weather has grown so much hotter.</p>

<p>Betty follows, and sits down wearily to
the account-books. Bob is evidently in an
unreasonable frame of mind. Where did
he get that violin? Has he promised to
pay for it? If so, how will he obtain the
money?</p>

<p>Meantime, Bob unrolls a sheet of music,
marked, "Exercises for the Violin," props
it upright on the table with the help of a
few books, draws the violin and bow from
the case, and places the instrument in position
under his chin with what he considers
quite a professional air. Then he takes up
the bow and draws it lightly across the
strings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>A horrible squeak is the result. Bob
looks rather blank; Betty shudders. She
has a keen ear for music, and such a discord
gives her real pain.</p>

<p>"Out of tune," mutters Bob, and he
screws up one of the little pegs to tighten
the string; then he tries again. Another
squeak, louder and more utterly jarring
than before.</p>

<p>He repeats this process several times.
Betty is tired and worried; she endures in
silence for awhile, but suddenly her patience
gives way altogether.</p>

<p>"Bob, what <i>are</i> you trying to do?" she
cries sharply.</p>

<p>"I am tuning the violin; can't you
hear?"</p>

<p>"Tuning! Why, you make a more
abominable noise every time you touch it.
What could have induced you to bring
that wretched thing into the house?"</p>

<p>"That's it, abuse a thing you don't
understand! It's a very good violin, only
the strings are a bit worn. Of course, if
I decide to have it, I shall get new ones."</p>

<p>"Worn&mdash;I should think they are! Look
here, Bob, you don't mean to tell me that
you're really going to buy that old thing?"</p>

<p>"I told you before, that is none of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
business. If I choose to buy it, I shall, so
don't give advice when it isn't wanted."</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i> my business!" cries Betty,
now thoroughly roused. "Who is to pay
for it, I should like to know? Haven't I
to work for the money to live on?&mdash;am I
not trying to work for it now? And instead
of helping me, as you ought, you make my
head whirl round with that horrid old
fiddle!"</p>

<p>Bob jumps up in a fury, and flings the
violin into its case. "So this is the way
a fellow is treated when he comes home to
practise! It'll be long enough before I
trouble you again, my lady, I can tell you!
I've plenty of friends who understand music
rather better than you do, and they tell me
that I ought to learn, and would soon play
very well. You used to say you wanted me
to learn yourself. Now I see just how
much your words are worth!"</p>

<p>And he closes the case with a loud snap,
and flings out of the room.</p>

<p>In a moment Betty realises what she has
done. She flies after him.</p>

<p>"Bob&mdash;Bob&mdash;stay one minute&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The street door closes with a bang. Bob
has gone.</p>

<p>Betty stands there, her head in a whirl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
How did the miserable quarrel arise? Just
after she had been feeling so happy about
her success with the girls, too. Oh, what
a wretched, wretched ending to the day!</p>

<p>Tired though she is, Betty cannot go to
bed until Bob comes home. At last she
hears his step, and flies to the door.</p>

<p>"O Bob, I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;" she begins
eagerly, directly she sees him. But he
pushes past her without a word, and,
running upstairs, shuts himself in his own
room.</p>

<p>Betty goes to her own room, too; but
not to sleep. What can she do to make
Bob understand how sorry she is for her
hasty words, how much she wants to help
him, how dearly she longs to win his
confidence?</p>

<p>She goes over the brief scene between
them, sentence by sentence, as nearly as
she can remember it.</p>

<p>"Bob was certainly overbearing and unreasonable,"
she thinks, her anger reviving
a little as she recalls his words. "Oh, but
it was my place to help him to be better.
I have promised to be the Lord's Soldier.
I should have been wiser and stronger than
he&mdash;and I wasn't, not one bit! I lost my
temper. I made no effort to check myself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>These are sad thoughts for poor Betty;
but it is often through just such a sense
of failure and shortcoming, through just
such self-reproaches as hers to-night, that
the Lord renews our strength. No spiritual
blessing is so full of power as that which
follows a time of humiliation. In distrusting
ourselves we learn to put a more perfect
trust in Him.</p>

<p>Bob still wears an air of deep injury at
breakfast next morning. He answers all
Betty's rather timid remarks with "Yes"
or "No," and seems even to take trouble
to show that all confidence between them is
at an end.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, Betty starts out on her
weary round of rent-collecting. Her sorrow
is heavy upon her, and she walks with
drooping head and unheeding eyes.</p>

<p>"Bob is wrong to bear malice like this,"
she thinks. "If he won't listen to anything
I have to say, how can I ever make
things right between us again? Would it
be right for me to go and ask his pardon?
It is plain that unless I do something he
means to have a grievance against me. Oh,
dear, I just feel no heart for my work or
anything while things are like this! Lord,
do lift the burden, do show me what to do!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Do help me to put a stop to the mischief
my foolish words have caused."</p>

<p>"The Captain!"</p>

<p>Suddenly turning a corner, Betty's eyes
fall upon a little group gathered round a
doorstep not twenty yards away.</p>

<p>Three or four shabby little children and
Captain Janet Scott. The Captain talking
to them, with all that tenderness and loving
sympathy that they have never had from
their own mothers, poor mites, and for
which their baby hearts are craving; the
children looking up into her face with eager
eyes.</p>

<p>The Captain! Just an accidental meeting
in a dull and dirty street; but to Betty it
is as though the Lord had sent one of His
own bright angel-messengers straight from
Heaven to help her!</p>

<p>She runs towards her eagerly; the Captain
looks up, and turns to greet her young
friend with a welcoming smile.</p>

<p>"Betty Langdale! My dear, I have been
hoping every day to meet you."</p>

<p>"O Captain, I am so miserable! I've
been so foolish, so wicked; I've made a
dreadful mistake, and I don't know how to
put it right. Do, <i>do</i> tell me what I ought
to do!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Scott takes the girl's trembling
hand, and looks attentively at her pale face
and the dark rings under her eyes. Then
she kisses the shabby little children all
round, promising to come again soon, and,
turning again to Betty, slips her hand
through the girl's arm, and begins to walk
slowly up the street.</p>

<p>"Tell me your trouble, dear. Perhaps it
is not so bad as you suppose," she says,
gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it is!" and Betty pours out
the sad little story of her quarrel and its
consequences. She does not spare herself;
as nearly as she can recollect she repeats
her exact words.</p>

<p>"You have been to the Lord about this,
Betty?" asks the Captain, gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've prayed and prayed, and
sometimes it seems as though I ought to
beg Bob's pardon; but then, you know, he
should <i>not</i> buy a violin just now, no matter
how cheap it is&mdash;we can't afford <i>anything</i>,
and he was wrong to worry me when I was
doing the accounts, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Certainly he seems to have acted rather
selfishly and unreasonably. But, Betty, you
must remember that he does not know this.
If you really mean to help your brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
you will have to teach him to understand
many things that are dark to him now.
Then, too, dear, you must learn to put
yourself in his place. He had evidently
been dwelling a good deal on the thought
that you would think it very clever of him
to learn the violin. Boy-like, he had most
likely forgotten the family troubles for the
moment, and was trying to 'show off'
before you. You had once said you wished
him to learn, and no doubt he now thinks
you very unkind and changeable because
you discourage him."</p>

<p>"But, Captain, just think&mdash;father in the
hospital, all the accounts and rent-collecting
to do, no money scarcely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but Bob has not thought of
all that. He has never heard the Lord's
voice calling him. He lives in a world of
his own. You must learn to get into his
world, to read his thoughts, to make him
feel that in you he has a real friend. Step
by step, dear, you must lead him to his
Saviour."</p>

<p>"But he won't listen. He'll hardly
answer when I speak!"</p>

<p>"My dear, it is that very barrier between
you which you must find a way to break
down."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Captain! how? How <i>can</i> I make
Bob understand that I want to help him?"
asks Betty almost despairingly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could show some interest
in his music. Do you play at all yourself?"</p>

<p>"The piano&mdash;just a little."</p>

<p>"And, evidently, you have a good ear.
Couldn't you offer to show him how to get
his violin in tune?"</p>

<p>Betty shakes her head. "I'm afraid he's
much too vexed to let me try. Oh, wait!
I've thought of something. Couldn't I buy
him a new violin-string? I believe one
snapped just before we had that wretched
quarrel. It would only cost a few pence, I
should think."</p>

<p>"Well, my child, I must leave all that
to you. Do what you can to make up for
your share in the dispute; only be sure to
show Bob that he must not act selfishly;
that he certainly ought to deny himself
any amusement, however good in itself it
may be, that would take money which is
needed at home.</p>

<p>"Speak quietly to him, dear. Remember
the Lord's words: '<i>If thy brother shall trespass
against thee, go and tell him his fault
between thee and him alone; if he shall hear
thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</i>'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! Betty, this is your first real attempt
to lead some one you love to think of higher
things. God grant you may become a real
soul-winner one day!</p>

<p>"Be very prayerful, very loving, very
wise. Use all the faculties the Lord has
given you, give your whole self to His
service, and trust Him! God bless you!
I shall pray for you and for your brother
too," and Captain Janet clasps Betty's hand
warmly and leaves her.</p>

<p>What a change the Captain's words have
wrought in Betty's thoughts! She is no
longer conscious of a heavy burden, for all
her heart is filled with courage and eager
hopefulness.</p>

<p>A soul-winner! Does Captain really
think she may be that one day? Oh, how
beautiful&mdash;how wonderful! A flood of joy,
pure and sweet, rushes over her heart at
the thought. Never, even with dear
Grannie, even among the breezy moors,
and blue hills, and clear skies of Grannie's
home, has she felt a delight so intense. It
is, indeed, as though she had caught a
glimpse of Heaven.</p>

<p>Ah! what does it matter though she does
live in a dull, city street; though her days
must be spent in common-place work? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
is the Lord alone who can give true happiness,
and to none who serve Him in spirit
and in truth does He deny His gift.</p>

<p>"Bob, is this the right kind of string?
You wanted a new one, I know. The
woman at the shop said it would most likely
be the E string that required renewing."</p>

<p>Bob, taken completely off his guard, looks
up eagerly from his tea and bread and
butter. "Yes, that's it; that's just what
I&mdash;&mdash;" He stops short, suddenly remembering
his determination never to speak of
his violin to Betty again.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> right? Now I call that fortunate,"
goes on Betty, quietly. "I expect you know
how to put it in, don't you, Bob?"</p>

<p>Bob melts still further at this. "Oh,
yes; Mr. Wright, one of the teachers at
my school, showed me how to put strings
in. It's easy enough."</p>

<p>"Ah! but I've heard father say that it's
very difficult to get a violin in tune after
fitting in a new string."</p>

<p>Bob's face clouds over again; but Betty
hastens to add, "Couldn't I help you a bit
with the tuning? Couldn't I sound the
notes on the piano while you screwed up
the string&mdash;surely, that is the way people
generally do tune violins?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, Bob, dear?"</p>

<p>"You've got those accounts to do, or
something."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've done for to-day. Come, I shall
enjoy it, not the music, just yet, perhaps,
but I should enjoy helping you, Bob."</p>

<p>Bob makes no answer to this; but
directly tea is finished he runs upstairs for
the violin-case, and the brother and sister
are soon seated together before the shabby
little piano.</p>

<p>For the next half-hour there is little
heard between them, save&mdash;"Too sharp,
Bob." "A little lower still." "I say,
Betty, give us the octave of that note,"
and so on. At last the instrument is really
in tune, and then the pair try an exercise
together, with fairly good results. Bob is
delighted.</p>

<p>"Why, Betty, this is first-class! Mr.
Wright said I ought to get some one to
play with me."</p>

<p>"I should just love to do it, Bob."</p>

<p>There is a long pause. Betty feels she
ought to say something more, but doesn't
know how to begin.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;A little lower still.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I say, Betty"&mdash;Bob is speaking in
quite a different tone of voice now&mdash;"I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you didn't really think I meant to <i>buy</i> the
violin, did you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Bob, didn't you say so?"</p>

<p>"No; I said I'd take it if it suited me.
Charlie Wright&mdash;my teacher's boy, you
know&mdash;wanted to change it away for my
old camera."</p>

<p>"O Bob, I'm so glad&mdash;so very, very
glad. Oh, why didn't you tell me before?"</p>

<p>"I meant to; but you took a fellow up so."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see just how it all happened.
You must remember that I feel so anxious
about every penny while father is away,
and, Bob, I do want us all to think for
one another, and&mdash;and"&mdash;Betty makes a
great effort&mdash;"and try to live just as the
Lord would have us live, Bob."</p>

<p>Dead silence. Betty's heart beats rapidly.
Then come the most unexpected words she
has ever heard in her life.</p>

<p>"You <i>do</i> try."</p>

<p>"Bob! O Bob, don't say that. I don't
deserve it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do, Betty. Do you think I
haven't seen you trying? Come, come, old
girl, don't cry."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Bob; only I'm so happy.
I&mdash;&mdash;" Betty cannot trust her voice just
now to pronounce another word.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>FATHER AT HOME</h3>


<p>"Father coming home?" cries Betty, as
Mrs. Langdale folds up the letter, from
which she has just read an extract, "O
mother, how beautiful, coming home the
day after to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"How jolly!" shouts Bob. "Three cheers
for father!" "Jolly, jolly, three cheers!"
echo the younger children; and mother
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>is</i> good news. Such a dreadful
time it has been. I declare I've not felt
quite myself one single minute since he
went away. And, then, the money, too;
not that he'll be well enough to go on with
his work for months to come."</p>

<p>To Betty, however, the one joyful fact is
enough.</p>

<p>"But to have father home again! It
seems almost years since that night when
he lay on the couch, so white and still. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
say, mother, do let us give him a real
welcome home&mdash;do let us make him see
how glad we all are!"</p>

<p>"Why, Betty, what a girl you are! You
really should think before you speak. You
know very well that we haven't a penny to
spend on anything."</p>

<p>"Of course, I know. But, mother, that
isn't what I mean. Couldn't we <i>do</i> something?
For instance, I'm sure dear father
likes to see things neat and nice. Couldn't
we have a real big, spring-clean all over
the house?"</p>

<p>"A 'spring' clean in summer, you silly
child!"</p>

<p>"Well, you know what I mean. Let's
have the curtains down, and the carpets up,
and polish the furniture all over."</p>

<p>"That's a jolly good idea of yours,
Betty," cries Bob, enthusiastically. "And
I tell you what, you've helped me ever so
much lately, now I'll just turn round and
help <i>you</i>. I'm off to get the small pincers
from father's tool chest. Won't I have the
carpets up in no time! If we all work
together we shall soon get the job done."</p>

<p>Betty gives her brother a grateful look,
but mother says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't think your father will care a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
bit whether the house is tidy or not. He
has never said a word to me about the place
all the years we've lived here."</p>

<p>"Oh, but think! Coming straight from
the hospital. We must make everything
bright and cheerful. Poor father! Mother,
do you feel well enough to wash and iron
the curtains?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll do them; and Clara must clean
the windows. But, really, I don't see the
use of all this fuss and upset."</p>

<p>"I'll wash all the ornaments and clean
the pictures," says quiet Lucy.</p>

<p>"O Betty, may we darn up the holes in
the chair-covers?" cry Jennie and Pollie,
mindful of their work as Dorcas and her
neighbours.</p>

<p>"I'll black everybody's boots," volunteers
Harry. There is a general laugh at this,
but Bob calls out that he needs Harry's
help with the stair-carpets immediately.</p>

<p>So Betty has a houseful of volunteer
helpers, and pretty difficult she finds it to
manage them all. But she is blessed with
a clear head, and, as every one is working
for love, and really tries to do his or her
best, a great deal of work is got through
in the course of the day.</p>

<p>Clara comes out splendidly. "Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
coming home? O miss, that <i>is</i> news!
Brighten up the house? I should think
we would brighten it up, just as neat as a
new pin all over."</p>

<p>What a topsy-turvy house it is all the
rest of the day! Bob and Harry beating
carpets in the back-yard as though their
lives depended on it; Lucy perpetually
polishing glass, and washing china. Jennie
and Pollie busy with their needles; mother
ironing in the kitchen; Clara sweeping,
scrubbing, and black-leading; Betty all
over the house, encouraging, directing, and
doing a bit of everything by turns.</p>

<p>Bread and cheese for dinner, and a cup
of tea at tea-time, taken in the stuffy little
kitchen. Yet not a single grumble from
any one&mdash;even from Bob, who <i>is</i> a trifle
particular about his meals, as a general
rule!</p>

<p>How utterly tired out Betty is when at
last she gets to bed! Tired out, but happier
in her home than perhaps she has ever been
before. Bustle, confusion, dust, hard work,
yes; but brothers and sisters all helping
each other, all working together, all eagerly
looking forward to seeing dear father.</p>

<p>The same thing goes on all the next day,
but now the confusion is fast changing into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
order, and when the following morning
arrives&mdash;the morning of the eventful day
that is to see father's return&mdash;the house is
cleaner and fresher than Betty ever remembers
to have seen it.</p>

<p>It is four o'clock in the afternoon. Bob,
his hands in his pockets, is going from room
to room, surveying his share in the work
with great pride. Lucy is arranging a few
cheap flowers in a glass, the children are
all on tiptoe with excitement. Betty has
gone to the hospital to fetch father home!</p>

<p>"There they are, mother. Quick, here's
father!"</p>

<p>Father; crutches under his arms, one foot
held away from the ground by a long sling
passing over his shoulders; but father, for
all that; his eyes shining with love, as his
noisy boys and girls rush towards him,
followed by Mrs. Langdale.</p>

<p>"Gently, gently, young folks, or you'll
tumble father right over."</p>

<p>"Well, it's good to be at home again.
Why, mother, how cosy everything looks.
One needs to be away from home for a time,
I suppose, just to find out how good it is!"</p>

<p>"It was all Betty's doing," cries Bob.
"We all worked at the cleaning-up, but she
started it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Father sinks into the low couch. His
leg is still very stiff and painful; but he
smiles happily, and gazes all round with
such a contented look in his kind eyes that
even Mrs. Langdale is struck with it.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, I do believe you were
right after all. Your father does seem
quite pleased with everything, and I
thought he never noticed how the house
looked at all!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>LUCY</h3>


<p>For some days after father's return Betty
has eyes and ears for scarcely anyone else.
To see his dear face, to listen to his dear
voice, is such a true delight to her!</p>

<p>Then, too, his presence relieves her from
a great responsibility. True, he is much
too lame, as yet, to collect the rents, or to
call on Mr. Duncan; but he takes all those
tiresome accounts off her hands at once. It
is as though an actual weight had been
lifted from her shoulders, for she has felt
the anxiety of keeping Mr. Duncan's books
a heavy burden indeed.</p>

<p>But though Betty is deeply thankful to
be rid of it all, she is beginning to realise
how good this responsibility has been for her.</p>

<p>"I used to make such a fuss over little
things," she thinks. "Why, I was quite
upset if the girls came in with torn frocks,
and dirty faces, or Clara did not clean the
kitchen properly; worse still, I used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
behave quite rudely to mother if she forgot
to arrange the dinner in good time, or made
me close a window when I thought it ought
to be open. How irritable, how unreasonable
I was! How hasty and inconsiderate!</p>

<p>"Ah! yes. I see now that God <i>had</i> to
send me all these worries; I couldn't learn
how to bear little troubles, until I had been
through big ones. Dear Captain said that
in a happy home every one had his or her
true place. It was certainly never my place
to speak to mother as I used to do.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe mother has really loved
me better than I deserved. Poor mother!
Her life is much duller than mine; she has
never had such a friend as my dear Captain
Scott; she has never been in the country
to stay with darling Grannie; she has just
lived on at home, year after year.</p>

<p>"Why, it wasn't until I spent that lovely
time with Grannie that I saw how much
nicer things could be made here, and now
I really believe they <i>are</i> nicer. I'm sure
every one seems more cheerful lately.
Jennie and Pollie have greatly improved;
I'm so thankful to see that they have really
taken little Minnie White as a close friend;
she is a true Army Junior, and will do them
a world of good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harry doesn't seem <i>quite</i> so rough, and
as for Bob, well, he's a perfect dear about
those violin exercises now. I'm sure that
half-hour we have together over the piano
is one of the sweetest in the whole day;
and, really, 'Exercise No. 4' is beginning
to sound quite pretty.</p>

<p>"The only person in the house I can't
altogether make out is Lucy; she certainly
isn't all a sister should be, somehow. She
does her share of the work, I suppose; but
I declare I know more of Bob's thoughts
than I do of hers&mdash;she lives in a perfect
world of her own.</p>

<p>"She reads too much; I never knew such
a girl for reading&mdash;always over some book
or other. I mean to speak to her pretty
plainly about that, directly I get an opportunity."</p>

<p>Alas! opportunities for speaking "pretty
plainly" come only too easily.</p>

<p>The next day is washing day. Clara
Jones's mother comes in to help; mother
spends the whole day in the kitchen, and,
of course, Betty has plenty to do.</p>

<p>By dint of almost superhuman exertions,
Betty manages to inspire Clara and her
mother with a desire to get the work cleared
up before tea, instead of dawdling over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
tubs until late into the evening. Her efforts
are successful; by half-past four they have
actually finished, and Betty looks forward
to a rest, and cup of tea. She will ask
Lucy to make it directly.</p>

<p>"Lucy!" she calls. No answer. "Where
can that girl be? 'Lucy!' She must come&mdash;she
ought to come; this is really too
bad!"</p>

<p>She runs upstairs, still calling, "Lucy,
Lucy!" She peeps into every room; there
is no Lucy to be found.</p>

<p>At last a thought strikes her. "Surely
she hasn't hidden herself away to read in
the attic?" Betty's anger rises. Lucy is
in the attic, sitting all huddled up in a
chair, poring intently over a book; books,
and pen and ink, on the floor beside her.</p>

<p>"Lucy, what on earth are you doing
here? And to-day, of all days! I've been
searching the whole house to find you; we
all want our tea, and you are calmly
amusing yourself with a book!"</p>

<p>"Tea? It isn't tea-time yet, is it?"
stammers Lucy, her pale face flushing painfully
red, as she pushes her book out of
Betty's sight.</p>

<p>"You know I always like tea early on
washing-day," cries Betty, still more sharply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
"and I must say, I do think it most selfish
and thoughtless of you to go away by yourself
like this, when we are all up to our
eyes in work!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know; I thought the washing
was finished," says poor Lucy, her lip
beginning to quiver.</p>

<p>"That's nothing to do with it; we're all
tired and want our tea; but you never gave
that a thought; all you seem to care for is
to get away by yourself to read some silly
story-book. Such shocking waste of time!
Such unsociable behaviour! I only hope
you are not reading novels. I am sure it
looks as though you come up here sometimes
because you are afraid to let father
and mother know what you are doing!"</p>

<p>Lucy's head droops lower still, but she
makes no answer.</p>

<p>"Well, now, <i>is</i> it a novel?"</p>

<p>"No-o."</p>

<p>"Then let me see it at once."</p>

<p>"Betty, I'd rather you didn't; that is, not
just now; some other day, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't make any difference;
whatever it is, you've no business to waste
your time in this way. Do, for goodness'
sake, leave books alone for a while, and
attend to your work!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>That night Betty goes to sleep with an
uneasy sense that the day has not been
altogether well spent, in spite of the success
of her washing schemes.</p>

<p>Awakening, some hours later, with this
uncomfortable feeling strong upon her, she
begins to ask herself what has been wrong?
Conscience soon tells her that she has been
unkind to her sister.</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> speak sharply, and I certainly felt
very vexed; but, then, it was aggravating,
and there is really too much to do in our
house for that sort of thing.</p>

<p>"Of course, I know that Lucy is not so
old, or so strong, as I am; but she should
have remembered how much I like an early
cup of tea on washing-day, and&mdash;&mdash;. What
was that? Lucy, did you speak?"</p>

<p>Betty breaks off her meditations hastily,
and raises herself on her elbow. Is Lucy
asleep on the pillow beside her&mdash;surely, she
spoke just now?</p>

<p>She is speaking, or, rather, muttering, in
her sleep. How strange! Can she be ill?</p>

<p>Then Betty remembers, with a faint thrill
of alarm, that Lucy ate neither tea nor
supper; and, when mother asked the reason,
she said her head ached.</p>

<p>For a long while she lies awake, listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to her sister's uneasy whisperings. "Oh,"
she thinks, "why was I so unkind to her&mdash;suppose
she should be really ill?"</p>

<p>Lucy is really ill. After a troubled night
of feverish dreaming, she awakes to a consciousness
of great pain and stiffness in all
her limbs. A doctor is sent for; her parents'
worst fears are realised, Lucy is stricken
down with rheumatic fever.</p>

<p>She is very quiet and patient, and tries
hard not to complain. Her mother nurses
her, relieved by Betty now and then.</p>

<p>Love has taught Mrs. Langdale to be a
good nurse; love makes her forget her own
small illnesses and worries, and think only
of her poor little daughter's suffering.</p>

<p>The remembrance of her unkind words
gives Betty bitter pain. Lucy was ill when
she scolded her. Oh, if she had known!</p>

<p>After a while, as Lucy grows better,
Betty begins to excuse herself again. "She
<i>did</i> read too much; I was right in that,
and reading is waste of time&mdash;only I wish
I hadn't been so cross with her."</p>

<p>Slowly the pain grows less, slowly the
fever cools; but, alas! for poor Lucy, the
doctor says he fears that this illness will
leave lasting bad effects behind it; that,
though she will soon be fairly well, she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
never be quite as strong again as she has
been.</p>

<p>One afternoon, Betty is sitting with her
sister, while Mrs. Langdale rests. Lucy has
just finished her basin of bread and milk,
and Betty thinks she is asleep, until she
hears her sigh softly to herself, and then
make a restless movement on her pillow.</p>

<p>Betty is at her side in an instant.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Betty," she says, in
her weak, patient voice. But Betty sees
that two large tears are rolling down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"O Lucy, you mustn't fret, that's ever
so bad for you, and, besides, you're getting
well so fast. Shall I read to you? You
were very interested in some book just
before you were taken ill&mdash;tell me where to
find it."</p>

<p>"No, no, Betty, not that book; it's of&mdash;no&mdash;use&mdash;now."
Lucy's lips quiver so
painfully, that she can hardly pronounce
the words, and she buries her face in her
pillow.</p>

<p>"Lucy, don't! Oh, please, don't! I
was horrid to you that day, and I've been
sorry ever since. Do let me read, if it's
only to make up a little."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Betty, it's of no use. I can never,
never, never do it now. I heard the doctor
tell mother this morning that I should
always have to be careful, or I should be
just as bad again, and&mdash;and&mdash;it's only
really strong people who can do&mdash;what I
wanted to do." Lucy's voice dies away
into such a faint whisper that her sister can
only just catch the last words.</p>

<p>"Do what?" asks Betty, in great surprise.
Then, suddenly, an idea strikes her.
"Ah! Lucy, were you studying for something
all the time&mdash;not just reading to
amuse yourself&mdash;were you learning about
some work you wished to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Betty."</p>

<p>"And all these months I have never
thought of that. Oh, what was it? Come,
tell me, Lucy, dear."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to go to the poor heathen
women in India, some day, you know. I
had read how they suffered, and&mdash;and it
seemed that God was telling me to go. So
I got all the books I could about India&mdash;to
be ready when the time came&mdash;and I read,
and read, and even began to learn their
language."</p>

<p>"Why, Lucy, how <i>could</i> you do that?"
exclaims Betty, in the greatest astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"My music teacher's elder sister came
home from India a little while ago, and she
told me what books to get from the Library."</p>

<p>"And you did all this, and I never
guessed. How stupid&mdash;how blind I have
been!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, Betty. I ought to have confided
in you; but, somehow, I couldn't
speak of it. I felt it too much, and now it
is all at an end," and her sobs break out
afresh.</p>

<p>But Betty leans over the bed, and lovingly
draws her arm around her sister's neck.</p>

<p>"O Lucy, I feel that you forgive me for
my unkindness, but I cannot forgive myself.
When shall I get out of the habit of judging
too hastily? I can see quite well now that
you couldn't tell me your plans, because I
was always so full of my own affairs."</p>

<p>"Betty, Betty, that wasn't the reason.
You work so hard for all of us&mdash;how could
I bother you with my hopes and fears?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Lucy! I never met anyone with so
much to do, or so many folks to care for
as my dear Captain. Yet no one thinks
<i>her</i> too busy to listen to their troubles. I
must learn to be more like her&mdash;to empty
my heart of self&mdash;then, dear, you will never
hesitate to tell me everything."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>COMRADES</h3>


<p>"Clara, what <i>is</i> the matter with you?
You seem to be always fretting about something
lately. Now I really must know. Is
there anything wrong at your home?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o," comes in muffled tones from
Clara. She has her head turned away, and
takes care Betty shall not catch a glimpse
of her face.</p>

<p>Betty steps quickly across the kitchen,
and lays a hand on the girl's shoulder. It
quivers under her touch; yes, Clara is
certainly crying.</p>

<p>"Clara, you must tell me what it is. I
can't have you going about the house with
this miserable face&mdash;just when you were
beginning to get on so much better, too."</p>

<p>"Beginning to get on better! O miss
that's just where it is!" cries Clara, with
a sudden burst of tears. "I <i>can't</i> get on
better. I try and try, and make no end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
good resolutions&mdash;cart-loads of them&mdash;and
then I go and break them all again directly.
Seems as though my head was no better
than a sieve&mdash;I can't remember; it's of no
use&mdash;Oh, Oh, Oh!"</p>

<p>"Clara, Clara, don't, there's a dear girl.
And you have been doing better&mdash;ever so
much; father was saying so to me only
yesterday."</p>

<p>"But you don't know how hard it is&mdash;you
don't know how dreadfully I forget;
and then I think, 'Oh, what's the use of
trying? I'd far better give it all up, and
just muddle along as I used to do.'"</p>

<p>But Betty thinks, "Ah, that's just how
it used to be with me, before I went to
Grannie's, before I went to The Army
Meetings near Grannie's home, and gave
my heart to God. I have felt like that
sometimes since; but only for a little while,
for the Lord has always helped me through
the bad times. It is only the Lord who <i>can</i>
help us through. I ought to tell Clara that&mdash;I
<i>must</i> tell her!"</p>

<p>There is a moment's pause. Betty is
nervous, and doesn't know how to begin.
She makes an effort.</p>

<p>"Clara," she says softly. "Clara, have
you ever tried to understand those words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
in the Bible, '<i>Thou wilt keep him in
perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
Thee</i>'?"</p>

<p>Clara looks up suddenly; her eyes round
with wonder. "Why, Miss Betty, whatever
do you mean?"</p>

<p>Betty makes a greater effort. "I used to
feel as you do," she says. "I used to find
I couldn't keep the good resolutions I made;
I used to fall into dreadful fits of hopelessness,
of wanting to give up trying any
more; and then I went to Grannie's&mdash;my
Grannie is a Salvationist, you know&mdash;and
she took me to The Army Meetings. And
one night, all of a sudden, I saw quite
clearly how wrong I had been. I had been
trying to live a good life, trusting in my
own strength; and no one can do that. It
is only by coming to the Lord Jesus that
we can be truly good; for it is only Jesus
who can wash our sins away, and change
our hearts, and make us like Himself."</p>

<p>There is another silence. Clara has taken
up a corner of her apron, and is picking at
it industriously.</p>

<p>"You think, miss," she says, nervously,
after a while, "that&mdash;that if I went to The
Army Meetings I might find it easier to do
right?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm quite sure of it, Clara! O Clara,
pray for a changed heart, ask for it, claim
it! With the Lord for your Saviour, you'll
soon conquer all the little difficulties that
distress you now." Betty is nervous no
longer. She has broken the ice and her
words flow freely.</p>

<p>"And, Clara, salvation gives you such
a lovely kind of happiness&mdash;I can't explain
it&mdash;but very often you'll feel just the
happiest girl in the whole world. How
can people help being happy when they
know they are on the Lord's side, when
they know that He saves them, and loves
them, and will take them to live with Him
at last?</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there, I must go now, Lucy
needs her dinner; but, Oh! Clara, do
think of what I've said; do pray about it;
do ask the Lord to show you what to do."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"She&mdash;she knows <i>you</i>, miss," says Clara
softly.</p>

<p>Betty looks up from the toast she is
making for Lucy's tea. Some time has
passed, and Lucy is almost well again, but
Betty insists on waiting upon her as much
as ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who knows me?" she asks. "What
are you talking about, Clara?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the Captain," answers Clara,
shyly. A light breaks over Betty's mind.</p>

<p>"You mean my dear Captain! I'm so
glad&mdash;so very glad&mdash;and so you're going to
the Meetings regularly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>"Isn't Captain Scott sweet; isn't she
just like one of the Lord's own angel
messengers!" cries Betty enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Yes, miss."</p>

<p>"And she's helped you already, Clara;
you're feeling ever so much happier&mdash;I can
tell that by your voice."</p>

<p>Clara turns slowly round, and points to
an Army shield of silver, showing white
against her dark dress. What a changed
Clara! The tousled hair is smooth enough
now under the neat cap, the dress is tidy,
the apron clean. But it is not at hair or at
dress that Betty is looking, not even at the
shield-brooch. No, it is on the smiling face
that Betty fixes her eyes.</p>

<p>For the old, sullen, discontented expression
has gone, and the plain little face is
so bright with joy and triumph that it is
sweet to look upon.</p>

</div>

<p>"Clara!" she cries, and drops the toast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and throws her arms round the little servant's
neck. "So we're both Soldiers now&mdash;we're
comrades," she whispers. "Ah,
you know now just the difference salvation
can make&mdash;don't you, Clara?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, miss indeed I do!"</p>

<p>"God bless you, Clara!"</p>

<p>"God bless you, miss! it was all through
you," whispers Clara, shyly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>BETTY'S BIRTHDAY ONCE MORE</h3>


<p>Betty's birthday has come round once
more.</p>

<p>Autumn and winter have passed since
Lucy's illness, and Clara's conversion. Save
for a slight limp, father's knee is well
again, and Bob's progress with his music is
quite wonderful. But the most wonderful
thing that has taken place in the whole
year, is the change in Betty herself. She
<i>was</i> one of the most discontented girls to be
found anywhere, now she is one of the
happiest.</p>

<p>Directly she wakes up this morning she
sees that her room is full of bright spring
sunshine, and straightway begins planning
a little treat for her brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>"Jennie and Pollie have a half-holiday
to-day. How fortunate! We'll all go out
together this afternoon. A walk in the park
among the spring flowers would be just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thing for Lucy. If I could only get mother
to come too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Many happy returns of your birthday,
my dear, dear Betty!" Lucy's arms are
suddenly flung round her neck, Lucy's lips
pressed to her cheek. Her birthday! In
her planning for other people's pleasure
Betty had actually forgotten the day
altogether.</p>

<p>It is delightful that Lucy has remembered
it, though; and with a little laugh of genuine
joy Betty returns her sister's kiss, and then
devotes herself to the business of dressing.</p>

<p>Betty rather makes a point of being the
first downstairs in the morning; then she
is sure that father's breakfast is just as he
likes it, and the children's porridge properly
made. But this morning, as she passes
Bob's door, she notices that the room is
empty. Bob up already! Mother's room-door
standing wide. Are they <i>all</i> up before
her? Oh, she must have mistaken the
time! No, seven o'clock is only just
striking. What can it be?</p>

<p>She hurries downstairs, and now Lucy is
close behind her.</p>

<p>Yes, they <i>are</i> all up. The sitting-room
is full of people. Father, mother, Bob,
Harry, Jennie, Pollie, even Clara! For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
one instant Betty stares at them in utter
bewilderment, and then they all make a
rush at her, and she understands.</p>

<p>"Many happy returns of the day! Many
happy returns of the day!" and father and
mother are kissing her, and the boys have
hold of her hands, and the younger children
are shouting and dancing wildly about her.</p>

<p>Surprise and delight quite take Betty's
breath away; indeed it is not until they all
draw back a little, and begin holding up
various pretty gifts, that she can find a
voice to utter a single word. Even then
she can only gasp out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father, mother&mdash;Oh, to think you should
all remember my birthday like this! I shall
never forget this morning&mdash;never!" and
there are tears of love and joy in her eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shall never forget how bravely my
lass took over my work while I was laid
up in the hospital," says father, proudly,
as he fills her arms with flowers.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shall never forget how patiently and
unselfishly my little daughter works in the
home," whispers mother.</p>

<p>"I'm not the sort of fellow to forget a
good sister when I've got one, I should
hope," says Bob, in his manliest voice.
"Look, Betty, I've got you a little present;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it isn't half bad, though, is it?" and Bob
pulls out a showy photo-frame for which he
has been saving up his pocket-money for
some months past.</p>

<p>"Betty, Betty, we've hemmed you four
handkerchiefs&mdash;and, Oh, we've had such a
trouble to get them done without letting
you know!" cry Pollie and Jennie. Even
Harry has bought her a bag of chocolates;
and here is poor little Clara, with a pair
of mittens knitted by herself. "Do take
them, miss&mdash;please. You said we were
comrades, you know, and your hands do
get so cold sometimes."</p>

<p>So they surround her with birthday gifts,
and warm, loving looks; and Betty's heart
is full of joy&mdash;almost too full to let her
speak.</p>

<p>Last year Betty thought of little save herself&mdash;of
her own woes, her own difficulties,
and her birthday was almost forgotten.
This year she thinks for others, she forgets
herself. Betty&mdash;what would they do without
dear Betty? There is no fear that her
birthday will be forgotten any more by any
of them!</p>

<span class="caption">Betty thanks Him with a grateful heart.</span>
</div>

<p>Of course, Grannie's letter and parcel
arrive by the next post. Betty manages to
steal away to her room for a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to read the letter all alone. After a loving
greeting, Grannie writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Last year I was anxious about you, my
Betty; last year I sent you that little story
of the Love-bird, hoping that it might open
your eyes to the power love should be in
the home. I knew that the light had come
into your heart, but I feared that it had not
yet found its way into all the corners and
crooks of your character. You could not
be happy, you could not really help those
at home, whilst one little spot of darkness
remained. No, you could never <i>live</i> the
love we spoke about the morning you left
me, until your heart was all pure love. For,
Betty, my dear, I know well that your life
is full of many trials.</p>

<p>"And now I am anxious no longer.
With what a thankful heart I write the
words! Yes, now indeed, I see that the
Lord Jesus Christ reigns alone in your
heart; now I know that you are happy,
and making those around you happy also.
Thank the Lord, Betty, for the blessing He
is sending on your work in your home!"</p>

<p>And Betty does thank Him with a grateful
heart. She feels indeed like the Psalmist,
that her cup runs over with blessings; her
home seems to be now most beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Betty, what would you like best in all
the world&mdash;that is, of all the things I could
give you?" whispers mother that night.</p>

<p>Betty knows the answer to that question
well enough. "To&mdash;to be allowed to go
to The Army Meetings," she says, in a
husky voice, her heart beating thickly.</p>

<p>"I thought so. Well, father and I have
decided to let you go, if you still really
wish it."</p>

<p>"You'll let me go? Oh, mother&mdash;mother!"
and Betty's hands are tightly
clasped about her mother's neck.</p>
